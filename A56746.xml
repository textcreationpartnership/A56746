            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head type="sub">To His Loving Friends and Pariſhioners the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of St. <hi>Mary White-Chappel.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT was for <hi>your</hi> ſakes and for <hi>your</hi> uſe chiefly I compoſed this Diſcourſe, and now offer it to your ſerious thoughts and moſt laſting conſideration, that it may teach you the <hi>Right Knowledge</hi> and perſwade you to the <hi>True Practice</hi> of that <hi>Great Duty</hi> it treats of, I have endeavoured to ſet it in
<pb facs="tcp:103342:3"/>ſuch a Light as might remove the unreaſonable <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Deſpairs</hi> of ſome Few and the <hi>Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous</hi> and falſe <hi>hopes</hi> of the far greater number of Sinners. I hope if you carefully peruſe it with due thoughtfulneſs and application of mind it may give you both a Right notion and underſtanding of it ſo as to free you from all dangerous and miſchievous <hi>Miſtakes</hi> about it, and that it will convey ſo much <hi>Warmth</hi> as well as <hi>Light</hi> to your thoughts as may by the Grace of God very much help to quicken and excite you to a ſpeedy and thorough <hi>Repentance</hi> and to a Holy and <hi>Good life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As it will in ſome meaſure give you clear thoughts of Religion in all the parts of it, which ſome who have a ſtrong ſence yet have dark and confuſed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions about, and will enable you to make a right Judgment of your ſelves and spiritual ſtate by evident and obvious and certain marks, ſo I dare ſay that no Man who takes the whole force of it into his mind and duly conſiders and ſeriouſly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to all the thoughts that it will ſuggeſt to him will ever live in his ſins or continue to be a wicked Man.</p>
            <p>One of the great Reaſons that makes Men ſo even beyond <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Infidelity</hi> it ſelf (for they being contrary to the natural ſenſe of our minds prevaile not upon ſo many as <hi>Superſtition, Falſe</hi> and <hi>corrupt Religion</hi>) is the <hi>perverting</hi> Chriſtianity and <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting</hi> the Goſpel by Doctrines of <hi>Looſeneſs</hi> and <hi>Licentiouſneſs,</hi> that give falſe hopes of Pardon
<pb facs="tcp:103342:3"/>and Salvation without Obedience and a good life, and by ſome imaginary Schemes and ſome comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able but erroneous and even damnable Doctrines re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile Religion to Mens Luſts and the hopes of pardon and happineſs to a careleſs and wicked life.</p>
            <p>How this is done in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by their doctrines of Penance, Confeſſion and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, Contrition and Attrition and the like has been ſhown and made out by the Proteſtant Writers againſt them; and indeed I take thoſe Principles to be the very <hi>Rotten Core</hi> of Popery, the Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Philter by which it bewitches ſo many wretched Souls into its Communion, and the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian <hi>cup of Fornication that it gives the Kings and People of the Earth to drink.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Looſe Notions of Repentance which came at firſt from them, but have been taken up by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others ſince, put me upon this Deſign of Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining and Rectifying them, for I am perſwaded there never was any Error or any Deluſion of the Devil which hath deſtroyed more Souls then the fatal miſtakes about this Duty, eſpecially about a <hi>Dying Repentanc;</hi> which has been the wretched <hi>Reſerve</hi> of moſt wicked Men all their lives, and the broken <hi>Reed</hi> they have truſted to at their deaths, whereby they have been encouraged in their Sins and had a kind of Protection, as they thought, againſt all the dangers of them by this priviledge of <hi>Repenting</hi> at the laſt, and by having that allowed
<pb facs="tcp:103342:4"/>to be valid and ſufficient by the terms of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
            <p>By this they have all along had the reſerved hopes of ſaving their Souls however wickedly they lived, and ſo have excuſed themſelves from and ſhifted off the neceſſity of a Good life by this more eaſie and compendious way; which though it were liable to ſome more accidental hazards yet might as effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually do the Buſineſs by the ſtanding principles of Religion and by having, as was ſuppoſed, an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Title to Pardon and Salvation.</p>
            <p>This hath greatly comforted Sinners and greatly encouraged them in their sins, when as s common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid of a great many, they might hope though they lived very ill yet to dye well and make a good end, and by being penitent at the laſt like the <hi>Thief</hi> upon <hi>the Croſs</hi> to be ſurely pardon'd and go to heaven; and ſo this Comfortable Disjunctive has been ſet up or twofold way of going to Heaven, either by living well and being good Men before we come to dye, or elſe by Repenting and being ſorry at that time that we were not ſo.</p>
            <p>The Conſequences to Religion and a good life are ſo plain and fatal from hence, and I have known ſo many ſad Inſtances of its dreadful miſchief in my frequent attending the Sick (whereby my experience in this caſe, if not my skill, has made me a good Phiſician) that I thought I could not do more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to God and Religion, and the Souls of Men then to reſeue them from ſuch falſe Notions and
<pb facs="tcp:103342:4"/>pernicious miſtakes about a matter of ſo great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and do all I could effectually to perſwade them to the Practice of ſuch a true <hi>Repentance as is not to be Repented of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſerving ſuch an excellent Deſign makes me venture this Diſcourſe into the World without being concerned for the many Defects and Imperfections in the Style Phraſe and Words which a nice Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick may find in it, but I am ſure the pious and well-diſpoſed Reader will excuſe and overloook thoſe when he is affected with the thought and matter which is of ſo great moment and importance; and when he is ſatisfied with the vertue and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs of the Phiſick he will not I hope be ſo deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate as to find fault with its being either too much or too little gilded.</p>
            <p>I confeſs ſome part of it hath layn by me many Years (even beyond <hi>Horace</hi>'s ninth) and hath many youthful ſtrokes in it, to ſhow it was drawn before the reſt, and to excuſe its Dreſs and Colours; but the thought and Notion is all of a piece, and I have had it ſo long, and conſideered it ſo fully, that if any ſhall differ from me after reading it thorough, for the ſtrength of it lies in the Frame and Contexture of the whole and not in any ſingle part, I ſhould very much wonder and be glad to know his Reaſons.</p>
            <p>I have choſen ſometimes to repeat the ſame Notion as there was occaſion rather then to refer the Reader back again to another place, where there would not
<pb facs="tcp:103342:5"/>be ſuch an immediate connexion with what he was juſt reading, ſo that he would loſe the ſight of what went before with looking after it, and would not ſee the thing ſo well in one view.</p>
            <p>I have often thought that we wanted a Juſt and entire Diſcourſe of Repentance and all that relates to it, and have wondered that among all our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Practical Treatiſes we ſhould hardly have one ſuch ſitted for common uſe; among other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of which I believe this may not be the leaſt, That 'tis one of the moſt difficult things to write on an eaſie Subject, as tis the hardeſt to paint Light.</p>
            <p>When I drew the Model of this and had ſome of the Materials lying by me and ready framed, I thought the perfecting and finiſhing it would not have coſt me half the charge and pains and expence that I found it has, and moſt Writers I believe like Builders find this, and even afterwards when they have done they ſee many things they could mend and alter, though they care not for being at the coſt of pulling down again and building up anew: It was only the Strength and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency I had regard to, and it may have thoſe, tho' like a Houſe built by parts and not altogether, it want all that regular Order and Beauty that ſhould ſet it off. It is to be looked on only as a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Diſcourſe</hi> to teach an uſeful Truth in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and raiſe the Affections and Imaginations up to it, without that care and exactneſs that is to be
<pb facs="tcp:103342:5"/>ſerved in cloſer Writings: It will fully anſwer its end if it can but corvey a <hi>cleare</hi> and <hi>lively</hi> an <hi>underſtanding</hi> and <hi>warm ſence</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> into Mens Minds and free their Thoughts from ſuch Miſtakes and their Lives from ſuch Sins as are too prevailing in the World, and which like the Sea and its Rivers proceed from and maintain and run into one another; For Men's Luſts and Pices make them willing to take up with falſe and looſe Principles in Religion and thoſe Principles feed and promote their <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Sincerity and Zeal of ſerving ſo good an end, as I have had my Eye all along upon, or at leaſt of endeavouring heartily to do it, hath ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently armed me againſt all manner of Cenſures whatſoever, and hath given me more ſatisfaction then if I had either had the ability, or could have vainly promiſed my ſelf the Applauſe of writing the Wittieſt or Learnedeſt Book in the World. This however mean and imperfect it is, as I here put into your Hands, So I preſume to Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to the Great God and my Bleſſed Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the beſt <hi>Patrons</hi> who will certainly reward thoſe that ſerve them, heartily praying that it it may be Serviceable to their Honour and Glory, to the promoting Vertue and Religion, the bringing Men off from Sin and Wickedneſs, the Converſion
<pb facs="tcp:103342:6"/>and Salvation of Souls, and the <hi>Turning of Sinners from the Errors of their ways unto Righteouſneſs,</hi> that ſo both they and I may have the <hi>Rewards</hi> promiſed to all ſuch.</p>

               <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
               <p>REpentance is the great Goſpel duty which <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> came Preaching, as a Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to Chriſtianity; <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.2. Our Saviour alſo himſelf began with the ſame; <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.17. The Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples choſe the ſame ſubject to preach on, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.12. <hi>They went out and preacht that men ſhould repent.</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> in his Sermon to the <hi>Jews,</hi> whereby he converted three thouſand Souls, preaches to them this Duty, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103342:9"/>And this was what St. <hi>Paul teſtified to the Jews, and to the Greeks, repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, Acts</hi> 20.21. as if the whole ſumme of the Goſpel lay in thoſe two: Nay, our Saviour himſelf makes this the very end and deſign both of his Sufferings, and of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, <hi>that repentance and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in his name, Luke</hi> 24.46, 47.</p>
               <p>It is a Duty therefore of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt moment and importance in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and ought above all to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, practiced and underſtood.</p>
               <p>The only Queſtion is, Whether it be ſo proper and neceſſary to preach it to Chriſtians now, as it was at firſt to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles?</hi> The <hi>whole World then lay in wickedneſs, and God had concluded all under ſin,</hi> and in a ſtate of great corruption, both as to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Worſhip; ſo that Chriſt came then as a Phyſitian to cure the ſick, and preſcribed this Medicine of Repentance as proper to their caſe and condition at that time, and tells us himſelf, that <hi>he came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance, Matth.</hi> 9.13. But 'tis to be hoped that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103342:9"/>the World is well amended under Chriſtianity, that they who have been brought up in the knowledge of that excellent Religion, and been devoted to it all their lives, and had all the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities and advantages, as well as obligations of being vertuous, who have in their Baptiſm <hi>put on Chriſt, and dyed to ſin,</hi> and by the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Vows and Profeſſions been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to a holy life all their dayes, 'tis not to be thought that they ſtand in need of ſuch a Repentance, or of having it ſo preacht to them, or that they ſhall have the ſame benefit of it as the ignorant and unhappy World before the coming of Chriſt into it.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, Repentance was not a Temporary Duty in the beginning on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Chriſtianity, and fitted to the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were firſt brought over to it, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> would have Baptiſm, but it was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual and laſting Duty, ſuch as the weakneſs and infirmity of Humane Nature, and its aptneſs to fall into Sin, would make alwayes neceſſary; and ſad would it be for Chriſtians if they were not to have the benefit of it after baptiſm as well as before,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103342:10"/>which would put them into a worſe ſtate than Mankind were in before without Chriſtianity; but though Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance I own was preach'd to them then upon ſome peculiar accounts, and implyed a total change of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and their way of Life, which belongs not to Chriſtians, and was a Duty previous to Chriſtianity, and what was to go before their Baptiſm, and was hardly allowed to thoſe who ſhould afterwards Apoſtatize from it; yet it ſtill remains a Duty to us after we are become Chriſtians, ſo far as we are guilty of any Sin after we are waſhed in the laver of Regeneration: the vertue and benefit of it is not <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient</hi> and confined only to that time, but <hi>permanent</hi> and in force afterwards all our lives, if we truly perform it: And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the different nature and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of our Sins ſuch is our Repentance, as <hi>Phyſick,</hi> differently fitted to the nature of the diſeaſe, (ſo the beſt Authors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent it<note n="†" place="margin">

               <p>It was not a duty ſo properly of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Religion, becauſe it depended on, and is mainly encouraged by the Promiſe of Gods free Grace and forgiveneſs of Sin, which could not be known by natural light; but by that it was evident, that they who had done any thing fooliſhly and wickedly, ſhould become wiſer and better, and the reflection upon any bad actions was attended with ſorrow from the Principles of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſcience, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> excellently deſcribes it,<note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103342:11"/>the Remedy, and they felt only the ſmart which was Natural, but knew not the cure which was Chriſtian and Evangelical.</p>
               <p>The Prophets in the Old Teſtament preach'd Repentance to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and Pardon upon it, as fully and clearly as Chriſt and his Apoſtles in the New; but it was by vertue not of the Old, but the New Covenant which was in force before the Law, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17. and to this they owed all their Spiritual Bleſſings, ſuch as Grace, Pardon of Sin, and Eternal Life, as they did their Temporal, and the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to the other.</p>
               <p>Many of the <hi>Jews</hi> did not think ſuch a Repentance neceſſary to the partaking the benefits of the Meſſiahs Kingdom, as was preach'd by <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> and afterwards by Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, but they thought it was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to be true <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> or the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that this would entitle them to the Kingdom of the Meſſiah here, and Heaven hereafter.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> have this comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Legend among them, That <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> ſtands at the Gates of Hell, that if the Soul of a wicked <hi>Jew</hi> come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103342:11"/>he may keep it out, like to which ſome ignorant Chriſtians think now of Chriſt. <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> corrected this miſtake, when he bad them <hi>bring forth fruits meet for repentance; and think not to ſay within your ſelves, we have Abraham to our father, Matth.</hi> 3.8, 9. And ſo does our Saviour parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in his Diſcourſe with <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> about the neceſſity of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>John</hi> 3. and this was probably one great reaſon why they all began with, and ſo earneſtly preſſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended this Duty of Repentance, as neceſſary in the firſt place to thoſe who would be Diſciples of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>All Chriſtians generally do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the neceſſity of it, and, ſince we cannot live perfectly innocent ſo as to be free wholly from all manner of Sin, that we muſt inſtead of this entire Obedience, perform true and ſincere Repentance, which next to it is the moſt acceptable to Heaven.</p>
               <p>But there are grievous and fatal mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes about this Duty of repentance, which being made up of ſeveral parts, many are willing to take ſome of them for the whole, and to make the eſſence of it lye in thoſe things which are only
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103342:12"/>preparatory or inſtrumental to it; this being a <hi>Panacaea,</hi> the univerſal Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine of the Goſpel againſt all our Sins, they would compound it of ſuch piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and weak ingredients as will not work upon the diſeaſe, and drive out the corrupt matter, and have its due effect upon their Minds and Lives, but if it a little gripe and diſorder them, and they feel ſome remorſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction upon their Minds, and ſome tranſient Paſſions of Grief and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row upon their Souls, they think this is Repentance, though it have no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther influence to better and reform their Hearts and Lives. They look upon Repentance as a kind of bitter draught that muſt be taken, <hi>cum regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> like Spiritual Phyſick ſpring and fall perhaps, or at ſome ſet times, or after a debauch, or ſome great Sin, and this ſhall ſerve them for the whole year after, and they may then return to their ſins and looſeneſs again with more freedom and greater appetite, when that penitential courſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline is over; and thus they Sin and Repent, Repent and Sin, and never get out of that fatal circle: Or they may not put themſelves perhaps to all
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103342:12"/>this trouble, but leave it all to the laſt, and then reſolve to Repent at once for all the Sins of their whole lives, and ſo do the buſineſs more conciſely, and yet as effectually all together.</p>
               <p>This all proceeds from a wrong and wretched notion of Repentance, as if it conſiſted only in ſome ſudden paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Mind, and inward work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Thoughts, and not in the laſting change both of Heart and Life, and in the univerſal amendment of both. Thoſe who do not truly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, account it ſo eaſie and ſlight, and gentle a remedy, that will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form its work ſo eaſily and ſuddenly, that they are hereby greatly encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in their Sins, becauſe there is ſo preſent, and ready, and cheap a cure for them.</p>
               <p>Others who are of a different tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, made up of melancholly and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morouſneſs, they are apt to fall into the other extreme, and to think their Sins, though none of the greateſt, yet may be of ſuch a nature as ſhall never be forgiven; and they are extremely fearful and ſcrupulous, that they are of that ſort which the Scripture has declared unpardonable; and ſince
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103342:13"/>ſome ſeem to be ſo, they can never be perſwaded but theirs may be of that number or quality, and ſo they run into a thouſand doubts and fears, if not into abſolute deſpair of the truth and validity of their Repentance. All the failings and imperfections which are unavoidable to our Nature, and our preſent ſtate, theſe they mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie into heinous and mortal Sins, as others are apt to leſſen thoſe into weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and infirmities.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. I.</hi> Scripture Words for Repentance.</head>
                  <p>AS to a true Notion of Repentance there are ſeveral words in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by which it is expreſſed, the chief and moſt remarkable are theſe three, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. The two firſt we tranſlate by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and have no other word for them, the laſt is turning away from our Sins, and turning to God and Goodneſs. The 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is an after concern or trouble ariſing from our Sins, when our Mind and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſmite us when we have done amiſs, and we feel inward trouble and horrour ariſing in our Souls upon the reflection of our paſt folly and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103342:14"/>This is attributed to <hi>Judas, Matth.</hi> 27.3. <hi>Then Judas which had betrayed him, when he ſaw that he was condemned, repented, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</hi> So that this is but a low part of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, though if it be duly qualified, it may be that Godly ſorrow which <hi>worketh Repentance not to be repented of,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. If the bitterneſs we taſte in Sin turn our appetite from it, and our grief quite remove our love for it; if our tears help to waſh away our Sins, and to cleanſe our guilty and polluted Souls, then however ſharp or brackiſh they are, they are ſanative and medicinal, and ſo have a true ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and efficacy in them, without which they are uſeleſs and inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant. 2. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is an after thinking, or an after-Wiſdom and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when the Sin we thought before ſo charming and inviting, ſo that it tempted us with its ſeeming Pleaſure or Profit, or ſome appearance of good, which was the reaſon we choſe and embraced it, we now ſee and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand to be fooliſh and unreaſonable, miſchievous and pernicious, and are under full convictions of the ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences and effects of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103342:15"/>have both wiſhes and deſires that we had never committed it, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes and reſolutions not to be guilty of it again: Now this goes a great deal further than the other, but ſtill it goes no further than the mind, and the inward thoughts, paſſions and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons there, which may be if not inſincere yet ineffective. There muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing further to make up and perfect Repentance; which is 3. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, turning from Sin, and turning to God and Goodneſs. Thus the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks moſt clearly of Repentance, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.21. <hi>If the wicked turn from all his ſins that he hath committed, and doth that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not dye.</hi> Again at <hi>ver.</hi> 27. <hi>When the wicked turneth away from his wickedneſs, and doth that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſave his ſoul alive.</hi> And at <hi>ver.</hi> 28. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he conſidereth and turneth from all his tranſgreſſions that he hath committed, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not dye.</hi> So <hi>Acts</hi> 26.20. <hi>That they ſhould repent and turn to God,</hi> which are homony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, <hi>and turn from darkneſs to light, and from the power of ſatan unto God, ver.</hi> 18. This is leaving a wrong path
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103342:15"/>or courſe of actions we have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageds in, and entring upon a better. And this more fully declares the nature of Repentance, that 'tis an actual amendment and reformation of our Lives, <hi>a ceaſing to do evil, and learning to do well,</hi> as the Prophet expreſſes it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.16, 17. <hi>When they do good that are accuſtomed to do evil;</hi> as another Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23. when they who have been bad in any inſtance become good; this is the very eſſence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, as I ſhall further ſhew you, 'tis Obedience after Diſobedience, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue after Vice, Good after Evil, and theſe three together make up true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which is indeed the whole practical condition of the Goſpel, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſummes it up.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>SECT. II.</hi> Kinds and Degrees of Repentance.</head>
                  <p>BUT before I come to diſcourſe fully of that, I muſt premiſe ſome Limits and Cautions about this Duty, or elſe we ſhall talk very confuſedly about it in general, as belonging alike to all Perſons. Now there are ſeveral ſorts
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103342:16"/>and kinds of Repentance, according to the ſeveral kinds and degrees of Sinners.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome Sinners whoſe Lives are like a leprous Body ſpread all over with corruption and filthineſs, as the Prophet deſcribes the wickedneſs of the <hi>Jews, Iſa.</hi> 1.6. <hi>From the ſole of the foot even to the head there is no ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it, but wounds, and bruiſes, and putrifying ſores; i. e.</hi> They have been wicked in the general tenor and habit of their Lives; and theſe muſt be wholly changed, the whole maſs being corrupted it muſt be quite altered: The whole frame of their Minds, and whole courſe of their Actions muſt be made quite otherwiſe; like a defiled Body they muſt be waſh'd all over; or rather, like a dead Carcaſs they muſt be raiſed to life again, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored wholly from their ſtate of Death and Corruption which they were in before.</p>
                  <p>There are others who are not ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſed all over, but yet have ſome mortal illneſs growing in ſome part upon them, who are guilty of ſome particular Sins, ſome known and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Faults that deſtroy their good ſtate,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103342:16"/>and put them into the rank, though not of the greateſt Sinners, yet of ſuch Sinners as ſhall not enter into Heaven, nor eſcape Eternal Wrath and Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, unleſs they particularly repent of them, and wholly forſake and leave them: And thus every one who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to himſelf that he is, or has been ever guilty of any known and great Sin, whatever it be, though it ſhould be but one ſuch Sin, muſt amend that, and muſt get off that particular illneſs, or elſe it will prove deadly and mortal if it continue upon him; for one ſuch diſeaſe, or one ſuch wound, whilſt 'tis uncured upon the Soul, will kill and deſtroy it as well as more. Though a Man may not be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally depraved, nor be wholly proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to debauchery and irreligion, yet if he will indulge himſelf in any known Sin, or in any particular Luſt and Wickedneſs, he is in a loſt and undone ſtate, till he repents and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leaves that Sin: And if a Man is in a good ſtate, and fall into a wilful and great Sin, as we know <hi>David</hi> did, that ſurely cuts him off for a time from his good ſtate, and renders him lyable to Gods Anger here, and to Miſery here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103342:17"/>till by a ſerious and hearty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance he recovers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and is ſo perfectly recovered from the Sin that he will never commit it again, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Temptation is offered to him.</p>
                  <p>There are other Sins which are of a lower and leſs heinous Nature, which do not deſtroy our good ſtate, nor put us out of the Favour of God, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude us out of Heaven; and theſe are ſuch as very good Men are ſubject to, and may not be free from whiſt they are in this body of Sin and Corruption. As the moſt healthful and beſt Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions may be ſubject to ſome ſmaller illneſſes and indiſpoſitions of Body, though not to great and mortal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, ſo ſome frailties, failures and imperfections, will ſtick to the beſt of Men, though not any mortal and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sins; and theſe frailties and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities are Sins in a ſtrict ſenſe, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhort of perfect Obedience to the Divine Law; and theſe are in ſome ſenſe alſo to be repented of, <hi>i. e.</hi> we are to be ſenſible of them, and ſorry for them, and we are every day to pray to God <hi>to forgive us theſe our Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes,</hi> and we are to endeavour to overcome them as much as is poſſible,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103342:17"/>and never let them grow, as they may by neglect, into wilful Sins; but theſe are all pardonable by the Mercy of God, and by vertue of the gracious Covenant which he hath made with us in Chriſt Jeſus, upon a general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, without a perfect and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular amendment of all of them, which is utterly impoſſible and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Humane frailty and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
                  <p>There is therefore a great difference to be made, in reſpect of ſeveral kinds of Sins, and ſeveral ſorts of Sinners, of this great Duty of Repentance.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome of whom the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſayes, <hi>that they need no repentance, Luke</hi> 15.7. <hi>i. e.</hi> who need not ſuch a Repentance as ſhall change and alter their Spiritual ſtate, who never were in a bad ſtate, being early Baptized, nor never were guilty in their whole lives of any one ſuch great and wilful, and heinous Sin, as put them into a damnable ſtate: I hope there are not a few who are in this bleſſed conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore who need not this greater Repentance, as I think I may call it, who by the bleſſing of God, and by means of a very Vertuous and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103342:18"/>Religious Education, have been early trained up in the wayes of goodneſs, and never departed from them; who were ſet right at firſt, and never wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered or ſtrayed out of the paths of Vertue; whoſe Feet never ſlipt ſo far as to take hold of the paths of Death, or be caught in the ſnares of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; who never defiled themſelves with any great Sin, but have preſerved their virgin-purity, and have had no foul ſpot to ſully the whiteneſs and beauty of their whole unblemiſht Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but were alwayes innocent and alwayes ſafe, like <hi>Zacharias</hi> and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth were alwayes righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameleſs, Luke</hi> 1.6.</p>
                  <p>I cannot ſay theſe are wholly ſinleſs, and altogether perfect, for ſo none of the Race of <hi>Adam,</hi> or the Children of Men are, except our Bleſſed Saviour; for there are ſome infirmities, and weakneſſes, and imperfections, that belong to theſe, and ſo they ſtand in need of that leſſer Repentance I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpake of, but they never were guilty of the great offence, and ſo
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103342:18"/>need not that greater Repentance which others do.</p>
                  <p>And 'tis of that I now ſpeak, <hi>a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance from dead works,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle calls it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. A Repentance from wilful and mortal Sins, ſuch as put us into an ill ſtate, and ſuch as <hi>we ſhall certainly periſh except we repent of them, Luke</hi> 13.3.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. III.</hi> True Notion of Repentance.</head>
                  <p>NOw this Repentance I would thus deſcribe, anſwerable to thoſe three words by which it is expreſt in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>A ſorrow for our Sins, joyned with change and alteration of Mind, and amendment or reformation of Life;</hi> or ſuch a ſenſe of Mind as makes us leave and forſake, or turn away from every Sin, or all the Sins we have been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of, and practice the contrary Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, or perform thoſe other Duties we have broken or been wanting in. Thus, where we have been bad Men in any inſtance, and violated our Duty, and offended God, and broken or tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103342:19"/>his Laws, it will make us become good Men afterwards, and perform our Duty, and return to God, and keep or obey his Commandments in all thoſe caſes wherein we have done otherwiſe before. This, this alone is ſuch a Repentance as avails to Pardon and Salvation; as it takes away eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sin which would damn us, and brings us to that Obedience, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of all Vertue and Holineſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which <hi>no man can ſee God,</hi> or be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>Repentance, I own, is a word of an equivocal meaning, that ſignifies ſeveral things, and has ſeveral ſenſes belonging to it; as ſorrow and trouble of Mind, change of Thoughts, and the like; which are meant by the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin <hi>Paenitentia</hi> and <hi>Reſipiſcentia,</hi> and by the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; and it is commonly taken for ſomething that goes no further than a Mans own Mind, for the inward working and change of its own Thoughts, and the ſorrow and trouble it conceives upon the reflection of its paſt Sins, and the conſideration of its bad ſtate. And here it is Repentance muſt firſt begin, in the Mind, the principle of all Moral
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103342:19"/>actions, its being ſenſible of its evil wayes, and truly ſorrowful and afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them; when its Heart is ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten within, and bleeds as it were from thoſe inward wounds it feels in its own Conſcience, and when it vents it ſelf in all the ſorrowful expreſſions of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward trouble, when it <hi>weeps bitterly,</hi> like St. <hi>Peter, Matth.</hi> 26.75. and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of tears run down its eyes becauſe it has not kept the Law of its God; when it is <hi>pricked to the heart, Acts</hi> 2.37. and is under very deep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction and contrition of Soul, and mourns and laments for its grievous wickedneſs; when it is afraid of the anger and indignation of that God whom it has offended, and has a juſt dread of thoſe Puniſhments it knows it has deſerved; when it is under great convictions of the folly and evil of its Sins, and is very ſenſible of the ſad <hi>fruits</hi> and conſequences <hi>of thoſe things whereof it is now aſhamed;</hi> when it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders how little benefit and advantage it ever got by them when it commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, and to what a ſad account they now turn, and how that <hi>the end of them</hi> is like to be <hi>death</hi> and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This inward ſenſe and godly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103342:20"/>ſorrow, if it continue upon the Mind, and go not off like a morning dew, or an haſty cloud or ſudden ſtorm, will ſurely <hi>work repentance not to be repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of,</hi> will bring it to perfect and true Repentance, not only to Confeſſion and Humiliation, and afflicting its Soul by Faſting, and putting on Sackcloth and Aſhes, which may be ſigns and attendants ſometimes, but no proper parts or acts of true Repentance; but this will beget in it good purpoſes and reſolutions of becoming better, and forſaking its Sins, hearty wiſhes that it had never committed them, and ſincere vows and intentions to forſake them; for whilſt it has that ſenſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its Mind it cannot well do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Now this is a very good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and a very good part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; and it wants nothing to make it true, perfect and complete, but <hi>bringing forth fruits meet for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Matth.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.20. that is, all this having an effect upon the life and actions, mending and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming thoſe, and making them ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and agreeable to thoſe inward thoughts and paſſions of Mind, that we may be not only <hi>renewed in our

For Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is the whole practical condition of Chriſtianity, and together with Faith, makes up the entire duty of a Chriſtian, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſummes it up, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.21. <hi>Teſtifying both to the Jews and to the Greeks, repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.

                  <p n="1">I. A reliquiſhing and forſaking every Sin, or all the Sins we have been
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103342:21"/>guilty of. We muſt firſt break off the practice of thoſe, and ceaſe from any one act of them, and ſo we ſhall by degrees break the ſtrength and force of them upon our Minds: For as all habits grow upon us by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny repeated acts, which are like ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtrokes, as it were beating upon the Mind, that do form and faſhion it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a habit and diſpoſition; ſo when this force and impreſſion is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, the habit will grow more weak and languid, and the Mind will be able to recover and unbend it ſelf from it: Let us then reſolutely ceaſe from acting, and certainly if any thing be in our power our outward actions are, and we ſhall find that the moſt habitual Sin will fade and wither, as being without that recruit which ſhould feed and nouriſh it; for all Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits grow by new and repeated acts, as a Tree by the acceſſion of new ſap into its branches; and if they be not ſupplyed with theſe, they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay and dye of themſelves. If we can but put a little ſtop to our Luſts in their violent career, and check but a few acts of them, this will keep them
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103342:22"/>from being ſo unruly and ungovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, till in time we may wholly maſter and conquer them. The Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner muſt firſt keep himſelf from the outward act, from touching the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean thing wherewith he was defiled; he muſt refrain his feet from every evil way, and go on no further in a wrong path, that ſo he may return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wayes of Vertue. If his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance does not make him break off every Tranſgreſſion, and keep him back from every Sin, and reſtrain him from the commiſſion of what he was formerly guilty of, though it makes him never ſo much troubled and diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with what he does, though he commits it with never ſo much relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy, and is never ſo ſorrowful for it after he has done it, yet if he ſtill commits it, and repeats it when a Temptation is offered to him, he is very far from true Repentance; and let him be never ſo unwillingly drag'd to it, ſo that <hi>the evil which he doth he would not,</hi> let him not comfort himſelf with that, for ſo long as he doth it he is a ſlave to it, and he is <hi>led captive</hi> by it ſo ſtrongly, that it over powers even his Conſcience and his Reaſon, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103342:22"/>till he can break looſe from it, ſo as not to commit it again, he is a <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of ſin,</hi> and under the greateſt bondage and ſervitude. Let a Man have never ſo much diſlike of his Sins, and pretend never ſo much to abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and abhor them in his thoughts, yet if he commits them in his practice, 'tis but <hi>proteſtatio,</hi> as we ſay, <hi>contra factum,</hi> but a fruitleſs Repentance that ſtill brings forth the unfruitful works of darkneſs, for 'tis not what Men think of their Sins, but their not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, that is the true fruit of Repentance.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. As we muſt leave the Sin, ſo we muſt practice the contrary Vertue. And this will be more eaſily and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily done; for if the Habit of Vice and Wickedneſs be deſtroyed, that of Vertue will follow of courſe; as if the Diſeaſe be removed Health is reſtored. <hi>Virtus eſt Vitium fugere,</hi> The very leaving of Vice is the coming to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. For the Mind cannot ſtand ſtill, but is a moving and an active Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and if it be not Vicious it will be Vertuous, it cannot ſtand neuter and indifferent to thoſe two, but will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103342:23"/>take either one ſide or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He that leaves off Drunkenneſs, by ſo doing becomes ſober. He that will no longer defraud muſt neceſſarily become juſt. The contrary Vertue does in moſt caſes ſucceed the forſaken Vice, as Light does ſucceed Darkneſs, and Day Night. It does not I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs do it alwayes; for it does not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow that he who does not ſwear ſhould be devout, nor that he who does not cheat ſhould be charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nor that he who will not blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme God ſhould worſhip him, and yet thoſe are very meet and worthy fruits of Repentance, that he who has prophaned the Sacred Name of God by cuſtomary Swearing, ſhould not only leave off that upon his Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but with a Religious dread and awful veneration ſhould ever after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore and worſhip him; and he that has been unjuſt and unrighteous ſhould not only <hi>break off his ſin by righteouſneſs, but by ſhewing mercy to the poor, Dan.</hi> 4.27. That as <hi>ſin did before abound,</hi> ſo now the contrary <hi>Grace</hi> and Vertue <hi>may much more abound,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in another caſe, and as he ſayes in the like caſe to the <hi>Roman</hi> Chriſtians
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103342:23"/>who were once impure <hi>Gentiles, As ye have yielded your members ſervants to uncleanneſs, and to iniquity unto ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; even ſo now yield your members ſervants to righteouſneſs unto holineſs,</hi> Rom. 6.19. <hi>That now being made free from ſin, and become ſervants to God, ye may have your fruit unto holineſs, ver.</hi> 22. and that this fruit may be the greater becauſe of the former barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unfruitfulneſs which we were guilty of. He that has neglected any neceſſary Duty, and ſo is guilty of a Sin of Omiſſion, is bound to amend and repent of that as much as of any other Sin, and ſo Repentance will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him to the practice of all manner of Vertue, as well as the quitting and abandoning of all manner of Sin. The true Penitent muſt not only pluck up all the Habits of Sin in his Soul, and weed out all thoſe venemous ſeeds of Wickedneſs that have grown up into ſinful practices, but he muſt have all manner of Vertue planted in his Heart, and he muſt bring forth the fruits of his Repentance in an univerſal Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Holineſs of Life; and unleſs it does ſo, it is not as I ſhall ſhow you, true and perfect Repentance, becauſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103342:24"/>nothing elſe can reſtore the Mind to a ſoundneſs and a good ſtate. And Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is like a recovery of Health after Sickneſs. The diſeaſe muſt be thoroughly got off, the ſickly matter muſt be diſcharged, the illneſs muſt be cured and removed, and when that is done, the Patient muſt get his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſtrength, and be able to perform all the proper and vital operations, and till he does this we cannot ſay he is well: So till a Sinner has wholly got rid of his paſt Sins, and has utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relinquiſh'd and forſaken them, till he has purged them all out by Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and has brought himſelf, by the Grace of God, to ſuch a Spiritual ſtrength and ſoundneſs, as to perform the proper duties and operations of the new life, and to practice thoſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which were contrary to his former Vices, he cannot be ſaid to be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to a ſtate of Health and Sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and true Repentance. He may be under a method of Cure indeed, as a ſick Man is under a courſe of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and in ſome fair hopes and a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way of recovery before this, and this is often called Repentance, and 'tis a part of it but not the whole:
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103342:24"/>But the great work is not done, nor is his Repentance finiſh'd and perfected till he is come to this, to forſake every former Sin, and practice the contrary Vertue. How long he is to do this, I ſhall not determine, as I cannot tell how long a Man muſt be free from a Diſeaſe before he is well, and how much time exactly there muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a ſtate of Sickneſs and that of Health. 'Tis hard to fix the indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible point between thoſe two ſtates, and ſo it is between a ſtate of Sin and a perfect Repentance of it; but all Men can ſtill know pretty eaſily when they are well, and ſo they may by this ſure mark when they have truly and fully Repented, namely, when they have thus <hi>brought forth the fruits of repentance, Matth.</hi> 3.8. Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is not to be known, neither is it to be counted true, or at leaſt perfect without thoſe: Thoſe Fruits of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are not different from the thing it ſelf, they are not only ſigns, and outward marks and indications of it, as the Fruit of a Tree is a ſign that the Tree is alive, for here the Tree would not be alive at all, if it were without that Fruit. Theſe are not then only a ſign that his Repentance
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103342:25"/>is true; but they are like our Breath, which is not only a ſign that we are alive, but that very thing by which we live. True and perfect Repentance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in thoſe, and is never without them; as I ſhall ſhew by conſidering what an imperfect thing all the Repentance is which is done in a Mans Mind, without any effect upon his Life and Actions.</p>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103342:25"/>the better for them in their lives: And there are very few Sinners, I believe, that have not theſe now and then in their Minds, and do not ſometimes repent after this faſhion; they are often convinced of their evil courſes, and their Conſciences accuſe them for their Sins, and they find a great deal of trouble and diſquiet in themſelves upon the account of them, and they cannot but look back upon what they have done with ſorrow and trouble, and with ſome kind of dread and fear; and when they bethink themſelves they know they are in a bad ſtate, and they cannot but be melancholly and diſſatisfied with themſelves, and have ſome faint wiſhes that they had done otherwiſe, and ſome ſhort and ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual purpoſes and reſolutions to live otherwiſe ſometime hereafter, and to become better at ſome convenient ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but before that comes, the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is again offered, the Sin and the Company invites, the melancholly and the thoughtful mood is gone off, the dark and gloomy, and cloudy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that hung over his Soul is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up and diſperſed, and the Man falls to his Sins as freſh and as briskly as
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103342:26"/>ever, and he is never the better for that ſhort fit of Repentance that came upon him: It is quickly gone off, and he is rid of his Sorrow, and his good Purpoſes, but not at all of his Sins. And though it ſhould happen again to return upon him, as it will indeed, and he cannot well prevent it, yet he can put it off again by the ſame means, and can be wicked ſtill for all theſe fits and qualms of Conſcience that are apt now and then to come over his Mind; the Man is not made much better by all theſe, but his Sins ſtill prevail upon him, and he ſtill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits them, and is by no means brought off from them. As long as he is not, how little he can be ſaid to Repent, I ſhall now ſhew by examining all thoſe parts of Repentance, without this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let's conſider the Sinner in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and tears for his Sins, and in ſome trouble and contrition of Mind for them. This the Apoſtle aſſures us is not perfect Repentance; 'tis not the thing it ſelf, but 'tis that which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a likely and a good means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it, <hi>Godly ſorrow worketh repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance not to be repented of,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. but if it do not work that, if it do
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103342:26"/>not bring a Man to repent and leave his Sins, though he lament and weep over them; and when he is fall'n into any foul Sin, do only childiſhly cry over it, and not waſh and make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf clean, as the Prophet expreſſes it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.16. and put away the evil of his doings, when he is thus troubled for them, he is but little the better for all his ſorrow, and all his tears are but feigned and hypocritical without that. Though he is ſorry for his Sins, yet he will not part with them, but he ſtill retains ſo much love for them, that through his very tears, he ſtill looks kindly upon them and will by no means leave them; He is rather ſorry that he cannot keep them with more content and ſatisfaction to himſelf, but yet keep them he will, however trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome and uneaſie they may be now and then to him. Like <hi>Herod</hi> who was <hi>exceeding ſorry</hi> that he muſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie his <hi>Herodias</hi> in what ſhe required of him, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.26. but yet he did it for all his ſorrow. Men may ſee reaſon upon ſome account to be ſorry for their Sins; there are ſome conſiderations that will alwayes trouble their Minds in the commiſſion of them; there are
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103342:27"/>ſome evils and inconveniences that do unavoidably attend them, but yet there are other conſiderations of pleaſure or profit, or the like, that do ſtill prevail over thoſe, and ſo make them commit them: And though they are ſorry after they have done them, as 'tis very hard to ſuppoſe they ſhould not, yet there are other things that ſtill overcome them, and the Temptation of ſomething elſe, notwithſtanding this, is too hard and powerful for them. Sin cannot be brought forth without ſome pangs and uneaſineſs after it, but yet the fancied pleaſure inclines the Sinner to return again to it; and though he finds and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences ſome bitterneſs in it after he has ſwallowed it, yet the ſweet morſel is ſo pleaſant to him, that he will not refuſe or abſtain from it for all that. And thus, what is a Man the better for all his ſorrow, who is only ſorry that he cannot ſin without ſome trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but yet is ſtill reſolved to ſin with it, and after all his pretended ſorrow for his Sins, is ſo well pleaſed with them, that he yet lives in them. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is not the meer dropping a few brackiſh tears over our Sins, or
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103342:27"/>venting a few hollow and empty ſighs upon the remembrance of them, but 'tis an actual leaving and forſaking of them, which is the only ſign that we are ſorry for them in good earneſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A Man may be under great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of Mind of the evil of Sin, and of the ill ſtate he is in, as well as great remorſe and compunction of Heart for it, and yet not have true and perfect Repentance: For moſt Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have that ſome time or other, unleſs they are perfectly hardened and brought to a ſenſeleſneſs of Mind, and a ſtupidity of Conſcience. They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſin with ſome remorſe, and have ſome twitches and vellications of Conſcience, and condemn that in their Minds, which yet they may pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in their Lives. Few Men can go on ſo eaſily and comfortably in their Sins, but their Conſciences will ſometimes fly in their faces, and riſe up againſt them: And this is ſo far from leſſening or abating them, that 'tis one of the greateſt aggravations of the guilt of them, if they ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue thus to commit them againſt their Conſciences, and againſt the inward ſenſe of their own Minds.</p>

                  <p>No Man that does in the leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, but muſt know what a ſad and deſperate ſtate he is in whilſt he is wicked and impenitent, but 'tis not the meer knowing and being ſenſible of this will bring him out of it, no more than a Man that is ſick, and finds an inward weakneſs within him, or that feels himſelf mortally wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, muſt by ſo doing become well, and be immediately cured. This in all reaſon ſhould make him preſently uſe all means he can to be ſo: But 'tis not the meer ſenſe of his danger that makes him ſafe, it ſhould awaken him to do all he can to avoid it, and when he ſees it ſo plainly before him, not to venture into it with his eyes open: But 'tis plain that moſt Sinners do this; they know their Sins lead to the paths of Death, and that their wayes tend to Miſery and Deſtruction, and yet they are ſtill ſo mad as to walk in them, and therefore they are ſaid in Scripture to <hi>love death,</hi> and to <hi>chooſe deſtruction,</hi> becauſe they love and chooſe that which they know and are ſenſible will bring thoſe. The charms of Vice do ſo faſcinate and bewitch them, that they take down the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:103342:29"/>Poyſon, and eat of the forbidden Fruit, though they know they are both deadly; and there Luſts have ſuch power over them that they will ſtill cleave to them, tho' they know they ſhall periſh in their embraces. So that if Men be never ſo ſenſible of their danger, and never ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of their ill ſtate, by reaſon of their Sins, yet if this does not make them leave them, 'tis a ſign they love them ſo well, that they will boldly venture all for them, and never be brought to part with them whatever ſhall come of it. But,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A Sinner may ſometimes reſolve and purpoſe to leave his Sins, and that very ſincerely too, and yet his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance may not be perfect; for the thing is not done by a Mans meer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to do it, though never ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely. And Repentance is a different thing from a Mans reſolving to repent. A Man may be very Poor, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to be Rich, and very Ignorant, who reſolves to be a Scholar, and though the thing be never ſo much in his power, yet till he does that which he reſolves, he may be in the ſame condition he was in before. His reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:103342:30"/>indeed may put him upon doing the thing he reſolves, but till he does it, he is where he was. As a Man that is out of his way, and reſolves, upon finding he is ſo, to turn back, and to betake himſelf to the right path: This his reſolution does but at the moſt ſtop him in his wrong courſe, and till he does really turn, and go back, and get into the right way, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he reſolved, he is in the wrong way ſtill. Reſolution is a good principle of acting, and neceſſary to put a Man upon it, but till we really act upon it, 'tis not our reſolution to do the thing is doing it; and God, I am ſure, requires us to Repent, and not only to reſolve to do it. It would be very happy if a Sinner could be brought thus far, to reſolve in good earneſt to Repent, there would be then great hopes of him, but he muſt do more than reſolve, or elſe he is not much the better. There are many idle, and haſty, and ungrounded Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvers, who do very heartily and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, as they think, purpoſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to leave their Sins, eſpecially up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Beds of Sickneſs, and when they are under ſome preſent Judgment,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:103342:30"/>or the fear of Death, but when theſe are over, their reſolutions are ſo too; ſo that there is but little regard to be made of Mens reſolutions, unleſs they are put into act, and made good by a ſubſequent courſe of actions; without this no Man can tell whether the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and habit of his Mind be altered, and whether it be not a ſudden thought newly ſtarted in his Mind, which his awakened Reaſon for the preſent ſuggeſts to him, and ſo he yields to it, rather than a laſting Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that will dwell upon his Soul, and make a laſting impreſſion upon his Will and Affections: For Mens Reaſon may be perſwaded for a little time, when they only conſult with that, but they will be quickly drawn off from that when their Luſts and Affections are again taken in, and the ſtubborn Will will be quickly too hard for the weak Underſtanding. Hence it is that a Sinner ſo often changes his Mind, and he reſolves ſometimes to be good from the ſhort conviction of his Reaſon, but is quickly bad again from the prevalency of his Luſts and Affections. So that it requires ſome time, and ſeveral acts, to fix and ſettle
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103342:31"/>a Mans own Mind, and it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it can be changed and altered by a ſudden reſolution, without ſome tryal and many repeated acts, that ſhall keep it to what it reſolves; it muſt ſtand bent, as it were, that way ſome time till its reſolution become habitual, or elſe it will be apt to reſtore it ſelf again by a kind of Elaſticity, and a motion of reſtitution to its former temper and inclinations. When the Will has grown crooked by a long cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom and habit of Sin, it will not be ſet ſtreight again by a ſudden reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that may a little bend it the other way for a time, but it will return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to its former poſition, unleſs it be kept right by many new acts that bring it by degrees to a new habit. If a Mans Mind indeed were fully changed, and he that had a bad Mind before had now a good one, this I ſhould not doubt but would make him happy, and be true Repentance. But there goes more to do this than a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den reſolution. The old habits of Sin muſt be driven out, and they muſt be driven out the ſame way that they came in, that is, by contrary acts, and by a long courſe of other practices;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:103342:31"/>they muſt be unwound or unravell'd as it were by degrees, and the Mind cannot get looſe from them but by this courſe; and therefore it muſt not only reſolve within it ſelf, but it muſt make good, and confirm, and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then its reſolution by frequent pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices. or elſe it can neither attain to any habit of goodneſs, nor break off from a habit of wickedneſs. The wayes of Vertue and Vice are not ſo near to one another that a Man may take a ſudden jump out of the one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other by a ſudden reſolution, but they are like two contrary wayes, that a Man who is got into one, muſt go back again, and take over a great many ſteps, before he gets into the other. And as I ſaid before, 'tis not his reſolving that he will do this which ſets him in the other way, but he muſt walk back as well as reſolve, and he muſt move and keep on till he comes right. Meer reſolving is at moſt no more than turning his face t'other way; but if he only does ſo, and ſtands idly reſolving, he will be but little the nearer to his journeys end: And to be ſure if he goes back again, and breaks his reſolutions, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:103342:32"/>ſometimes walks one way, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the other, as many a Sinner does, who is uncertainly divided between his good and his bad reſolutions, and ſometimes follows one, and ſometimes the other, he is very far from true Repentance, to make which there muſt be nothing leſs than an actual forſaking of every Sin, and an amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of every evil way, which are <hi>fruits meet for repentance,</hi> or the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy fruits of Repentance, which both <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak of.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> The Motives to Repentance.</head>
               <p>HAving deſcribed the Nature, and fixt the true Notion of Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which is <hi>laying the foundation of Repentance,</hi> in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Phraſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. on which, after the old Rubbiſh is taken away, a good Life ſhould be built, and all the goodly ſtructure of Chriſtian Vertues ſhould be erected. I come now to propoſe the Motives and Encouragements to perſwade us to this great Duty, and they are as many, and as great, as there are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to Vertue and Religion, and diſſwaſives from Vice and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For Repentance is but a <hi>Return</hi> to Vertue, and <hi>Leaving</hi> Sin, and tho' the paſſage from one to the other may not be ſo pleaſant and delightful, but like the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> we muſt paſs through a Wilderneſs, through a vale of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and a courſe of Contrition and Humiliation, yet Vertue is the happy
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:103342:33"/>Land flowing with delights, and all manner of good things, and Vice is a more than <hi>Egyptian</hi> Servitude and Slavery, which he is mad that will not get out of, or that any way hankers again after it, or after the Garlick and Onions, the ſordid plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and enjoyments of it. I ſhall firſt examine the Temptations and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements to Sin, and expoſe the falſe Reaſonings and Arguments by which Men are drawn into that; then offer the Motives and greater Arguments to Repentance, both from the Nature and Reaſon of the thing, and from the Goſpel or Chriſtianity.</p>

                  <p>THe Enticements and temptations to Sin and Wickedneſs are ſo great and many, that if we ſhould judge of them by the effect and power which they have upon Mankind, they are much ſtronger than the Motives and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Vertue and a good Life; for we ſee they prevail upon more than the other do. Whole crowds follow
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:103342:33"/>the one, and are drawn by them into the broad way of Vice, whilſt Vertue has but a ſmall party who walk in her narrow path, and are perſwaded to keep cloſely to it. Now ſurely there muſt be ſome mighty and powerful charms in Vice that make it ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally take with moſt Men; there muſt be ſome ſecret and prevailing Reaſons that bring them over, and engage them ſo firmly on that ſide, and make Vertue ſo generally forſaken and deſerted. Men are Rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and free Agents, that have a power to conſider and chooſe what is beſt for them, what tends moſt to pleaſe and delight, and make them happy, and they muſt be greatly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon if they chooſe that which tends only to make them miſerable. God ſets Life and Death before them, as <hi>Moſes</hi> before the <hi>Jews, Deut.</hi> 30.15. and it muſt be great madneſs to chooſe the worſer part, and what one would think it impoſſible for any man to do, if his Reaſon were not cheated and deceived with falſe appearances of good in it, and it were not repreſented to him in ſuch a falſe light, and ſuch falſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, as made it ſeem quite otherwiſe
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:103342:34"/>then it is in its own Nature: For no Man can chooſe Evil as Evil, naked in it ſelf, and with its own uglineſs and deformity about it, but it muſt be dreſt up under the ſhow of Good, and painted and decked up in a mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricious dreſs, to hide its Native and abominable Filthineſs. Mens Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations muſt be deluded, and ſo their Reaſon deceived and impoſed upon by the Temptations to Sin; and there muſt be a great many falſe reaſonings uſed to entice them to it, or elſe ſo many who have thoughts about them, and who cannot do any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thinking ſome way or other, could never be drawn over to conſent to it, and to commit it.</p>
                  <p>Now the chief Deluſions, and falſe Reaſonings and Perſwaſions by which Men are drawn into Sin, for there muſt be ſome ſuch proceſs in their Minds, are ſuch as theſe following.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They ſee and feel the preſent Good of their Sins, and the after Evil is ſo uncertain or ſo remote that they know not what to think of it, and ſo are not much influenced by it, for they think it unreaſonable to part with the preſent Pleaſure, and the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:103342:34"/>Profit which their Sins afford them, for an unknown, and unſeen, and unconceived Pleaſure and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they know not when or where; they find and feel moſt Vices very grateful to their Natural Appetites, and outward Senſes, and they are not ſuch fools as to be perſwaded out of thoſe, nor to put a force and reſtraint upon Nature and its proper enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Vertue tyes them up to ſuch ſevere, and hard, and unnatural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints, as they cannot endure; its Mortifications and Self-denyals are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uneaſie to Fleſh and Blood, and they look upon its Rules and Precepts as the moroſe dictates of peeviſh and melancholly Men, who cannot ſo well enjoy what others do, and therefore talk againſt the liberties and freedoms of Humane Nature, and fright Men from the pleaſures and enjoyments of Sin here, with the terrours of another World, and imaginary dangers here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>Is it then ſo very certain that Vice is ſo pleaſant here? So deſirable and comfortable upon the account of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent enjoyment, and that its puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hereafter is ſo unknown and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain?
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:103342:35"/>That 'tis not to be taken into conſideration, nor worth being more minded than it is by theſe Sinners; do they never think of dying? or are they poſſeſſed with ſuch a frenzy as to hope they ſhall live alwayes, or that three or fourſcore years will never be run out, though few live ſo long, and they perhaps have lived above half that time, and ſee how quickly it is gone, and then will any Man in his wits venture to be miſerable for ever, for the Pleaſures or Profits of Sin which are but for a ſeaſon, were they never ſo great? If there were a much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter uncertainty about another World then there is, yet who would run ſo dreadful a hazard, who would put ſo great a matter to ſuch a dangerous venture? Were not the evidence we have of a future ſtate from Nature, from Revelation, from the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chriſt, nay from the belief of all Mankind ſo ſtrong as it is, ſo that not only whatever the <hi>Jews</hi> or the Chriſtians have believed and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed down through all Ages muſt paſs for a fable, if it be not true, but what all Wiſe Men have ever believed about a God and Religion, muſt be a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103342:35"/>meer dream and <hi>chimaera:</hi> Yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever no Man can ever be ſure but that there is another World, he can have no poſitive proof or demonſtration that there is not, and were there no more in it but that there may be ſuch a thing, which the greateſt Atheiſt or Sceptical Infidel cannot pretend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, yet this might be enough to keep him from running upon ſo dreadful, though meerly poſſible danger, and expoſing himſelf to ſuch extream but irrecoverable miſchief, eſpecially for the poor and pitiful temptations of Sin at preſent. For alas however plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and delightful they may imagine them, yet they are generally miſtaken, and there is more true pleaſure and comfort, a thouſand times, to be found in a Life of Vertue and Religion than in the moſt tempting Wickedneſs, and the moſt guſtful Senſuality: For which yields moſt preſent pleaſure and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of Life, a ſound and healthful Body, a fair and good Reputation, a quiet and eaſie Mind, or a ſhattered and rotten Carkaſs, a ſcandalous and infamous Life, a guilty, and diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and diſtracted Conſcience? Are not moſt of the pleaſures of Sin not
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103342:36"/>only ſhort but ſickly? That have a ſharp and poyſonous ſting hid under all their ſweetneſs, ſo that however they go off to the Palate, yet they are very bitter after they are gone down; whereas the pleaſures of Vertue are clear, and pure, and laſting, not mixt with any of thoſe dregs which foul and embitter Sin, but purified from all the ſediment and the lees that are at the bottom of Senſuality and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Religion does not deny us any truly Natural and proper Pleaſure and Enjoyment, but only keeps us within the bounds of Innocency and Vertue, within which compaſs a Man may enjoy all the Pleaſure that he can wiſh, or was made for. It does not by its Rules of Mortification and Self-denyal deſtroy or cut off any Natural Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, or true part of us; that is not the meaning of <hi>cutting off a right Hand,</hi> or <hi>plucking out a right Eye, Matth.</hi> 5.29, 30. but only to deſtroy the unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Exceſſes, to cut off the vitious Corruptions, to take away the depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and inordinate Affections and Luſts, that will grow too ſtrong and unruly, without a wife conduct and government of our ſelves by the rules
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:103342:36"/>of Vertue and the reſtraints of Reaſon and Religion; and would any Man think fit to have thoſe let looſe, and have the reins thrown upon their neck without any check or controul? Will he complain of the ſeverity of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the loſs of his Natural Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by the reſtraints of moroſe and peeviſh Vertue, as he calls it, if he be not allowed the full ſwinge of his Luſts, and the gratifying of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Paſſions and Deſires in all manner of inſtances? Then adieu not only to the government of Vertue and Religion, but the government of all Humane Laws and Worldly Wiſdom, which for the conveniency of this World, and the Peace, Quiet and Comfort of this preſent Life, has thought fit to keep Mens Luſts and Paſſions within ſuch bounds under the ſevereſt penalties, and to prohibit the ſame Sins under the puniſhments of this World, that God has done under the far greater puniſhments of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for nothing is more pernicious and deſtructive to the welfare of a Kingdom, as well as of particular Men, then Licentiouſneſs and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, which beſides the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:103342:37"/>Judgments of God upon it, does by its own Nature bring a thouſand preſent Miſeries and known Evils a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with it, beſides the unknown and unſpeakable Miſeries that attend it in another World.</p>
                  <p>Can any Sinner deny this, when he ſeriouſly thinks and conſiders of it? Does not his own obſervation, and his own experience, by which I hope he will be inſtructed if by nothing elſe, teach him that this is the Nature of Sin? That as 'tis a common peſt and plague to the World, and to Mankind in general, ſo 'tis generally a diſeaſe to his Body, a moth and canker to his Eſtate, and a worm to his Conſcience: Whereas Vertue is <hi>health and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his Body, life to his Soul, and grace to his Neck,</hi> as the Wiſe Man obſerves, <hi>That length of dayes are in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and honour. That ſhe is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her, and happy is every one that retaineth her, Prov.</hi> 3.16, 17, 18, 22. This true Notion of Vertue, which is not an empty Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrick, but a ſtrict Truth founded in Nature, that will alwayes be true of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:103342:37"/>it, and that all Wiſe Men will find to be ſo, this will ſufficiently anſwer the firſt and greateſt Temptation by which Sin entices and allures unthink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men with the bait of preſent Pleaſures and Enjoyments. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The next greateſt Temptation to Sin is that of Example, which is ſo ſtrong and powerful that few can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt it, who love to be modiſh and in the faſhion, as too many Vices gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally are, and therefore are more tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon that account, and loſe their reproach and ſhame due to them, by the great party and number they have on their ſide, which otherwiſe would ſneak and be confounded if they ſtood alone; but when ſo many are brought over to them, others follow if it be only for company; and many Men are drawn in even contrary to their inclinations, by the Example of others, becauſe they do not care to be ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, nor to be reproached for being ſo, but are willing to do what they ſee ſo many others do, and hope they ſhall fare as well as they, and eſcape all the ſeeming dangers of their Sins, both here and hereafter, as well as the reſt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:103342:38"/>of their Neighbours, or the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their fellow Sinners. Now this, however common and powerful it be, yet is the moſt unreaſonable thing in the World; for is any Man in another caſe willing to be ſick, or to dye, for company? Is any ſo eaſie or ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant as to pledge another in a cup of Poyſon? Or would he not ſtop the mad Frolick when he ſaw the reſt of the company drop down dead before him? Is any Man unwilling to avoid the Plague if he can, becauſe there is a general infection, and becauſe ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Neighbours or his Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance have dyed of it? Would any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the ſaving his Life, and eſcaping if he could upon a plank, becauſe the reſt of his company are ſinking and drowning? Did Men think it as much worth their while to ſave their Souls as their Lives, how many others ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever loſt them, had they as juſt and terrible apprehenſions of their own Damnation as they have of their dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this Temptation of Example and Company would be quickly taken off, and ſignifie nothing: For alas, what comfort will it be in the flames of Hell to hear ſo many others roaring
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:103342:38"/>and howling in them? To hear their hideous cryes, and tortures, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, will not abate their own, but rather increaſe them; therefore the Rich Man in the Parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.28. did not deſire the company of his Brethren there, but rather ſought to prevent their coming into <hi>that place of torment.</hi> The Devils indeed, from the unaccountable malice of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, tempt others to be as wicked and as miſerable as themſelves, and every one does their work who entices another to any Sin, but this will not eaſe their pains but augment them, by adding more miſchief, and ſo more guilt to them.</p>
                  <p>No Man who knows what it is to be happy, but muſt wiſh to be ſo, tho' he were alone, and no Man who knows that Vertue alone is the way to be happy, but muſt chooſe to be Vertuous though he ſaw never ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others Wicked; let them reproach and laugh at him as long as they pleaſe for a Man ſingular and by himſelf, let them count his Life folly for being ſo ſtrict and ſo preciſe, if it be, in the great matters of Vertue, for not Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the utmoſt pitch, not daring to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103342:39"/>Swear the leaſt Oath as other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do, not running into any the ſame exceſs of Riot, or cuſtomary Wickedneſs, but living up ſtrictly to the Rules of the Goſpel, and the Terms of Salvation there laid down, without any ſuch abatements as the looſe Opinions or the looſe Practices of others are willing to put upon them, ſince God will not alter his Methods or Judgments by any of thoſe, let them, I ſay, condemn or deride him never ſo much for this, and call him preciſe Fool, or formal Saint, or the like, yet no Man that knows the good of Vertue will be laughed out of it by a nick-name, or be aſhamed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſingular in that any more than in any other excellency of Learning or Knowledge above others; and I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe none of thoſe who are ſo much againſt ſingularity, but would be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be Rich though never ſo many others were Poor, and why not then to be Vertuous, which is ten times more valuable, though never ſo many others were Vitious. Example indeed is very prevailing, and like a Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſpreads and diffuſeth it ſelf very ſecretly and inſenſibly, and infects all
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:103342:39"/>about it, becauſe it begets the ſame thoughts, the ſame faiſe principles, and ſo makes Men have leſs ſenſe of the evil of Sin, and of the danger of it, but where a Man has fixt and ſteddy thoughts of thoſe, there the power of Example and the Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it to unwary and unſetled Minds, is taken off and removed.</p>
                  <p>Having examined thoſe Enticements and Temptations by which Men are generally deluded into the deceitfulneſs of Sin, and expoſed the falſe Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Sophiſtry, which impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and perſwade them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, I ſhall now offer the many Motives and Encouragements, and greater Arguments, to make Men leave their Sins, and perſwade them to Repentance.

                  <p>THE Motives to Repentance from the Reaſon and Nature of the thing, ſuch as would perſwade a Wiſe Heathen, or any Man of Senſe and Underſtanding, to Repent, after he had been fooliſh and wicked, <hi>Theſe</hi> muſt be taken from the manifold evil and miſchief of his Sins and Vices, which though they invited him at firſt with the appearing charms of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or ſome other ſeeming good, yet now he finds upon a better Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a ſerious Reflection upon them, that they are poyſonous and bitter, painful and irkſome, and have a thouſand ill conſequences and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effects that do neceſſarily attend them, and are the curſed Fruit that ſpring out of that root of bitterneſs; that though they are a little pleaſant to the taſte, yet they are Gall and Wormwood i'the Stomach; and like the Grapes of <hi>Sodom,</hi> though they look fair to the eye, yet they are but bitter and poyſonous, <hi>as the poyſon of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:103342:40"/>dragons, and the venome of aſps, Deut.</hi> 32.33. and that there was little or no <hi>fruit in thoſe things whereof he is now aſhamed,</hi> and beſides, <hi>that the end of thoſe things is death, Rom.</hi> 6.21. That he has Naturally an inward fear and dread of a Divine Nemeſis and Vengeance hanging over his head, and of ſome grievous Puniſhment or Evil befalling him for any ill thing he has done, and that he finds by his own wiſer thoughts and better obſervations, now that he has given himſelf leave to think, and to conſider things over again with calm Thoughts and ſober Reaſon, after that his Luſts are cool, and his Paſſions more ſedate, that Sin is but diſguiſed miſery, that it is the mother of all evil and miſchief, as it is the daughter of folly and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that the moſt tempting Vice is but as a Pandar, <hi>whoſe wayes lead to death and deſtruction, Prov.</hi> 3.17. and that Vertue is the only true way to Comfort and Happineſs, <hi>That the wayes of that are wayes of pleaſantneſs, and all its paths are peace, ver.</hi> 3. and that <hi>the effect of it is quietneſs and oſſurance for ever, Iſa.</hi> 32.17. So that we muſt ſuppoſe ſuch an one brought to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:103342:41"/>by ſuch Conſiderations, and by ſuch a Method as this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He is brought to think and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider by ſome Accident, Affliction or Judgment, by Sickneſs or the fear of Death, or ſomething that awakens his Mind, and the powers of Reaſon and Thinking, which rouze his ſtupid and ſenſleſs Soul, and excites his Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick drowſie Faculties, dozed with brutiſhneſs and ſenſuality, and which does, in the Scripture Phraſe, <hi>bring him to himſelf, Luke</hi> 15.17. This is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally done not only by the Grace of God working inwardly upon his Mind, but by ſomething elſe alſo at the ſame time, from without which touches him to the quick, and <hi>enters</hi> like <hi>Joſephs</hi> fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters even <hi>into his Soul,</hi> and with its piercing keenneſs ſtimulates, and even forces him to attend and conſider, and think, whether he will or no, of his Spiritual ſtate and condition, and then when he looks about him, he fees what a woful ſtate he is in, deep and in the mire of Sin and Guilt; to go forward he is afraid, for he now ſees the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful precipice before him, which he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned not before, when he ran blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:103342:41"/>into Sin, or without ſenſe or fear of danger, <hi>as the horſe ruſhes into the battle,</hi> and how to go back he knows not, 'tis ſo difficult, and he is ſo plunged in the depth of wickedneſs, but he ſees he muſt periſh inevitably if he do not ſtruggle, and do what he can, and endeavour to the utmoſt to get out of his miſerable condition, ſo he prayes to God to help him, and ſadly bewails himſelf, and laments, and weeps over his wretched caſe which he finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in, and has brought himſelf to: He repents and grieves for his paſt folly, and is now willing to repair and amend it, and to <hi>ſnatch</hi> himſelf, if he can, <hi>as a brand out of the fire,</hi> and to lay hold upon ſome plank that may ſave him from ſinking in this dreadful ſtorm, wherein he finds he has <hi>ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreckt his Conſcience,</hi> and the <hi>waters are gone over his Soul,</hi> and he is ready to be ſwallowed up of the gulph of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, then he makes Vowes to Heaven, and whilſt the ſame thoughts continue upon his Mind, reſolves to keep them, and if they go not off when the ſtorm is over, or he do not forget them when he comes to ſhore, and is ſet upon dry land, but theſe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:103342:42"/>ſtrong impreſſions laſt upon his Mind, and leave a due ſenſe abiding upon his Soul, even when the violent cauſe is over, and the affliction is removed, then he is like to be a good Man, and to repent in earneſt, and theſe thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-ſtrokes of Providence may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtartle and rouze him, but as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of ſome Animals, they may make him conceive and bring forth a new and holy Life, and be available to his true Converſion and Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and I believe this is Gods uſual way by which he begins to effect this upon moſt Sinners, by thus bringing them to ſome ſerious thinking and conſidering. It is very great Mercy when God thus checks them in their career, and calls to them by the loud voice of his Judgments, and thus, as he generally does, puts the firſt ſtop to them, and makes them bethink themſelves and conſider; but then this method muſt not only awaken, but keep their eyes open, and make them ſee and conſider thoſe other Thoughts and Reaſons which are the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſeminal Principles that will be more likely to produce and beget this true Repentance. Such as are,</p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:103342:42"/>
                  <p n="2">2. In the ſecond place, a ſerious reflection and thorough conviction of the Evil that is in Sin, and of the real Good of Vertue, as the only thing which can make us truly happy; for till Men have brought themſelves to be fully perſwaded and convinced of this, and to believe it as firmly as they do any truth in Mathematicks, or any other Science, they will never be brought truly to Repent, that is, to diſlike, and hate, and renounce the one, and heartily to love, and perſue, and embrace the other; for Men will ſtill love their Sins, and hanker after them, and be ready to comply and cloſe with them upon every occaſion; if they only fall out with them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, as Lovers do with what they like and admire, and tho' there may be ſome bickerings between them, and ſome penitential paſſions and reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments now and then, yet they may ſtill have their Heart, if they do not upon wiſe obſervations and thorough convictions, believe them to be ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to their Welfare and Happineſs, to the comfort of their Lives here, and their Eternal Salvation hereafter, and that they get nothing by them but
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:103342:43"/>poor, and empty, and ſickly pleaſures, but that they bring ſubſtantial miſery, and bitter remorſe and anguiſh of Mind, and a thouſand miſchiefs and inconveniences along with them at preſent, beſides the terrible hazards and dangers of another World, ſo that they are by no means to be loved or choſen, if we love our ſelves, or chooſe our own Happineſs: For we muſt bring it to this, if we would be ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and certain, to the firſt Principles of Self-preſervation, and a deſire of our own Happineſs, which lyes at the root of our Nature, and what we ſhall alwayes act upon, if we rightly underſtand it, and do not groſly err and miſtake about it, and a few wiſe obſervations, and a little ſober think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and conſidering will eaſily ſatisfie us, and fully convince us, that Vice is the certain cauſe of miſery to us, and that Vertue is the only way to be truly eaſie and happy. The Sinner will be convinced of this by his own experience, when he reflects upon his paſt follies, and ſees how little he has got by his Sins but ſhame and ſorrow, and trouble of Mind, perhaps a ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and diſeaſed Body, and a waſted
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:103342:43"/>Eſtate, and wretched Beggery, and every thing that ſhall make him miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in this World, before he goes to the greater miſery of another. For do we not dayly ſee this, how one Man brings himſelf by his Sins to a morſel of bread, how he ſhipwrecks his Fortunes as well as his Conſcience, by Luxury and Prodigality, another conſumes his Body as well as his Eſtate by Debauchery, Luſt and Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; by theſe <hi>they ſin,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle remarks, <hi>againſt their own Bodies</hi> as well as againſt their Souls; they make them bear the ſcars and marks of their Sins upon them, and become Martyrs in the Devils ſervice, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure often more torture of Body for their Sins, than other Martyrs have done for their Religion; ſacrifice their Lives to them, and by living too faſt, as they call it, bring an untimely death upon themſelves, and are in ſo much haſt ſometimes to dye, that their Bodies often rot before they come into their graves. If theſe miſchiefs do not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low all Sins, yet ſome others do, and the greateſt of all is inſeparable from them, which is torment and anguiſh of Conſcience, and pain and uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:103342:44"/>of Mind, which every Man feels, unleſs his Conſcience be ſtupified and mortified, which is a worſe ſtate than the other, upon the commiſſion of any great Sin, and this is ten times greater than any fancied pleaſure in it: This is a ſting, a wound, a prick upon the moſt tender part of a Mans Soul, <hi>a dart ſtruck through his Liver,</hi> a Worm gnawing upon his Vitals; nothing is ſo cloſe and ſo cutting a pain and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery as a Mans own ill Conſcience, when it is let looſe upon him, and like a Fury falls upon him with its ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt rage, laſhes him with its ſnaky whips, and burns him with its fiery torches, 'tis then a Devil let looſe, and a Hell kindled within his own boſom. They who have felt but a little of it, know it is more exquiſite pain than any belongs to the Body, and what is it then to endure this for ever, and lye under that, and the further anger of God to all Eternity. Oh madneſs and folly, that wants a name, that will do this for any Sin whatever! Oh the dreadful Evil of Sin, that brings all this, and ſo many other miſchiefs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us! But,</p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:103342:44"/>
                  <p n="3">3. Vertue on the contrary, has a thouſand Comforts, Bleſſings and <hi>Goods,</hi> belonging to it, which ſhould make us love it as we do our ſelves, and chooſe it as heartily and firmly as we do our own Happineſs. When we rightly underſtand and conſider it, we ſhall find Reaſon to do ſo; <hi>that</hi> neither diſturbs our Mind, nor diſeaſes our Body, nor ſquanders away our Eſtate, nor brings any reproach and diſcredit along with it, as Vice gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally does; and it takes away no real Good, or true Pleaſure, or proper En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment from us, but it allowes us all that we can deſire, or that our Nature was made for, within the due bounds and limits of our Duty, and within thoſe we may enjoy as much Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and Innocently, as the greateſt Liberty and Debauchery can afford the Sinner. Vertue does not deſtroy our Pleaſures, but refines and purifies them, and ſo makes them ſweeter and better, and draws them off from the filthineſs, and ſediment, and bitterneſs that lyes alwayes at the bottom of all ſinful Pleaſures and Enjoyments.</p>
                  <p>No Man ever repented of his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, or was ſorry that he had done a
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:103342:45"/>good Action, but he finds great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſatisfaction within himſelf when he reflects upon it, and it is a prop and ſtay to his Mind, and he reſts ſecurely upon it, and is chearful, confident, and erect under all acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and all dangers and difficulties whatſoever. His Heart ſtandeth right, and approveth it ſelf to God, and to his own thoughts, having no ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, no baſe and mean ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, but ſuch only as are good and vertuous, and this gives him great peace, firmneſs of Mind, and bravery of Spirit, and he feels an inward ſtrength and vigour in himſelf, and the conſtant ſprings of joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort riſing up in his own breaſt, and overflowing his Soul.</p>
                  <p>But Vice ſneaks and is cowardly, and fills a Man with fear and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and all the mean, and little, and uneaſie, and tormenting Paſſions that belong to Humane Nature.</p>
                  <p>Vertue approves it ſelf to our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and agrees with the native ſenſe of our own Minds, and has a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral beauty and lovelineſs that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends it to our firſt ſight and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, and makes it amiable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:103342:45"/>eſteemed and honoured, and admired by every one, even by thoſe who forſake it, who cannot but be ſo juſt to it, as to commend and approve it very often in others.</p>
                  <p>But Vice has a Natural uglineſs and deformity that makes Men aſhamed of it after they have committed it, and commit it in darkneſs and obſcurity, and after to deny and extenuate it, as being preſently ſenſible of the folly and undecency, and unreaſonableneſs of it, as having done what they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not juſtifie, and what preſently flyes in their faces, if they have not a brow of Braſs, and a forehead of Steel. It is contrary and awry to our own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and againſt the firſt ſenſe and tenderneſs of our own Minds, ſo that great violence muſt be uſed to commit it at firſt, and great pain follows upon it. 'Tis a force, a Rape upon the Virgin-modeſty, and the Natural ſenſe of Good and Evil that we are born with.</p>
                  <p>Vertue has alwayes very good and deſirable effects upon us in this Life, as well as great Rewards in another. 'Tis in the Wiſe Mans Phraſe, and in a true literal ſenſe, <hi>Health to our
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:103342:46"/>navel, and marrow to our bones, Prov.</hi> 3.8. It keeps our Bodies in good plight, neither drains or exhauſts them with forced Pleaſures, or unruly Paſſions, nor choaks or ſuffocates them with immoderate loads, nor drowns and waſhes them away with floods of drink, and cups of intemperance.</p>
                  <p>It brings a <hi>Bleſſing of God</hi> upon our Eſtates, and often <hi>makes us Rich</hi> by the help of Induſtry and Frugality, whilſt nothing is ſo expenſive, and ſo impoveriſhing as Vice, which <hi>ſpends</hi> many times all upon its Luſts, and the hungry Wolf comes often to the door where the Swine and the Goat have been uſed to dwell. Though Vertue may not alwayes bring abundance, neither is it deſirable alwayes to a wiſe Man, though <hi>Solomon</hi> puts Riches as the common Bleſſing <hi>in the left hand</hi> of Wiſdom, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.16. yet it makes <hi>a little that the righteous hath better than great riches of the ungodly, Pſ.</hi> 37.16.</p>
                  <p>Honour and a good Name do more certainly belong to Vertue than Riches, and whilſt Vice brings a blot and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach upon a Mans Credit, Vertue makes him loved, and honoured, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:103342:46"/>eſteemed by all that know him while he lives, and embalms his Name when he is dead, and makes his Memory to be precious.</p>
                  <p>But above all, it makes a Man tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eaſie and happy within himſelf; it ſecures him the peace and tranquillity of his own Mind, which is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt happineſs in the World: So that all Natural Good, and all that is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to Humane Nature, growes as a proper Fruit out of Vertue, which is the true Root that Naturally brings forth all Good, as Sin does all Evil; and theſe are ſo annexed to them by the nature and conſtitution of things as effects to their proper cauſes, that nothing can cut them off or precide them, and theſe beſides all the ſuper-added Motives of revealed Religion, are by plain Reaſon and obſervation of things, very ſtrong Arguments to bring Men off from Vice to Vertue, <hi>i. e.</hi> to true Repentance.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Therefore Fourthly, A wiſe Man when he comes to reflect and conſider, finds that that which hindered him from ſeeing all this before, was only his fooliſh Luſts, and his corrupt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fual Inclinations, and his ſtrong Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:103342:47"/>and violent and unreaſonable Appetites, which blinded his Reaſon and clouded his Judgment, and dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened his Underſtanding, and beſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, intoxicated and bewitched him, <hi>i. e.</hi> by ſome unaccountable wayes hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him from diſcerning and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering theſe things which are ſo plain and evident, and therefore the reaſon why he before choſe Vice and forſook Vertue, was becauſe he did not ſee and conſider this, nor was ſo truly convinced of the Evil of Sin, and the Good of Vertue, but now he has quite other thoughts and apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about them, and therefore he is changed in his Will and his Affections, by this change wrought in his Mind, and his Underſtanding; and this being a laſting and effectual change upon all the inward principles of action, has a neceſſary influence upon his outward actions that are alwayes moved and turned by thoſe inward ſprings and wheels within us; for though a Man is ſtill at liberty, and is under no force and compulſion from without, but acts freely from within himſelf, yet his Will will follow the laſt dictate of his Underſtanding, and he will not
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:103342:47"/>chooſe Evil as Evil, when he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends it to be ſo, and he muſt ſome way have his Reaſon corrupted, and judge falſly and erroneouſly, before he will practice ſo: <hi>Omnis peccans ignorat.</hi> If he has a true and lively ſenſe of the Good of Vertue abiding upon his Mind, he will not chooſe Vice again: 'Tis this ſenſe, I doubt not, confirms the bleſſed Spirits above, and will do the Souls of all good Men in Heaven, when they ſee and know this ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly that 'twill be impoſſible for them to fall, but now we ſee things darkly, and judge weakly, and often change and alter our Minds, as not having ſuch a clear view of things, nor attending ſo cloſely to the dictates of impartial Reaſon, but our thoughts are often lured off by the temptations of the Fleſh, and our Minds hearken but to one ſide, to the falſe reaſonings and ſuggeſtions of the Devil and our own Luſts, or are ſurprized with the ſudden importunity of a temptation, before they can recollect themſelves. Elſe no Man could ſay, <hi>Video meliora probo<expan>

                  <p>We ſhall be aſhamed that we were ſo cheated and impoſed upon, ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded <hi>by the deceitfulneſs of ſin,</hi> that we were ſo weak as to be governed by our mean paſſions and low inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are the imperfection and the ſoft ſide of our Nature, and that we ſhould not live up to that Reaſon which is proper to us, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes us from brutes, that we ſhould hearken only to the deſires of our Senſes and our inferiour Appetites, and not to the wiſe voice and dictates of Reaſon and Underſtanding which God had given us. We ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the folly of this, and ſee the many ill effects that have come of it, when we conſider rightly, and weigh
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:103342:48"/>things impartially, and make judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not by our Luſts and Paſſions, but by right Reaſon and Wiſdom, and ſhall condemn our ſelves when we grow cool, for all the mad frollicks and extravagancies we committed in the heat of folly, and ſhall then feel the pains and wounds they gave us, tho' we were not ſenſible of them before. Then we ſhall ſee that danger which before we were not duly aware of, and have a dread and terrour of that upon our Minds which is the due puniſhment of our Sins; for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of our own guilt will fill us with terrible fears, and we ſhall find <hi>the burden greater than we can bear,</hi> but how fully to get rid of it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and a <hi>deſideratum</hi> in Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and therefore we muſt go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than that for the other Motives to Repentance, which are fetcht from Revelation, and from the Goſpel and Chriſtianity under which God <hi>now commandeth all men to Repent,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. <hi>now</hi> more than heretofore, namely, by ſome more proper and peculiar Motives, greater than Mankind had before to encourage them to this Duty, ſuch as

                  <p n="1">1. NOW then by Revelation and the Goſpel we have an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods pardoning us upon our Repentance, which the World could not have without a Revelation, for this depends upon the free Will, and anbitrary Pleaſure of God, to which he is not obliged by his Eſſential and Natural Goodneſs, and of which we cannot be certainly aſſured without an expreſs Promiſe and Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Nature taught all Mankind that there was a God, the knowledge of this is not to be had from Revelation, but muſt be ſuppoſed as previous and antecedent to it; we learn it not from the Bible, but from the great Volume of Nature that lyes every where written before us with the plaineſt Marks of an Infinite, and Perfect, and Wiſe God, and in that, the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of his Goodneſs are as legible as theſe of his Power and Wiſdom, by
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:103342:49"/>
                     <hi>making his Sun to ſhine on the evil and on the good, and ſending Rain on the juſt and the unjuſt,</hi> and by other the Natural proviſions and contrivances for the good of his Creatures, God has ſhown himſelf to be no evil and malicious Principle, as ſome <hi>Hereticks</hi> imagined, but a Being of Goodneſs, which is an Eſſential Perfection of his Nature, and as Natural and Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to him as his very Being. And this Goodneſs belongs to him not only as a Creator but a Governour, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges him not to condemn an innocent Creature, nor inflict more miſery up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it than he gives it good by its Being. His Natural Juſtice, as well as his Goodneſs, hinders him from doing any injury by his Power, or acting contrary to the unalterable Rules of Right and Wrong, from dooming Men to Miſery by an Eternal Decree before they had offended him, from puniſhing any one more than he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, for the fault of another, and for any fault of its own that was wholly inevitable and unavoidable, but after Men have wilfully offended God, and been guilty of voluntary Crimes, and preſumptuous Diſobedience againſt
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:103342:50"/>his known and Righteous Laws, and ſo fallen under his juſt Anger and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, that then he ſhould not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them as they deſerve, this his Natural Goodneſs does no way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of him; if it did, then he could never puniſh any Sin, nor make any uſe of the Sword of Juſtice, but his Goodneſs would tye up his hands, and put a neceſſary and conſtant reſtraint upon him, which would make it whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inconſiſtent with his other Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, and with his wiſe Government of the World, in order to which it is more neceſſary to puniſh Sin than to forgive it. If it be not inconſiſtent then with Goodneſs to puniſh Sin, it is not neceſſary from that, it ſhould be forgiven, and God is not obliged to do this from his Eſſential or Natural Goodneſs, but it depends upon a more Free and Arbitrary Grace and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that was not included in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Knowledge of God, or in the Notion of the Divine Goodneſs, as a neceſſary part of it, and ſo not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the Light of Nature. Gods Goodneſs is over all his Works, and yet, ſo far as we know, he never of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered forgiveneſs to a great number of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:103342:50"/>his Creatures when they once rebelled againſt him, and yet the Devils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves can bring no juſt impeachment againſt the Divine Goodneſs notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that, no more could we have done if God had dealt thus with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, if he had puniſht us as ſoon as we wilfully broke his Lawes, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver admitted us to Pardon. A good Lawgiver is bound only to give righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and good Lawes to his Subjects, and if they break them they make themſelves juſtly lyable to the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was threatned, and 'tis no more contrary to Goodneſs to inflict that, then it was at firſt to threaten it; and though that be very ſevere and terrible, yet if it exceed not the merit of the Crime, <hi>i. e.</hi> if it be no greater than is neceſſary for the ends of Government, for that is the only true and full meaſure by which the proportion of the Fault and the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment can be adjuſted, 'tis no way contrary to the Goodneſs of the Governour to ſee it executed. I do not think he is alwayes obliged to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh by his vindictive Juſtice, no more than he is obliged to pardon by his Eſſential Goodneſs, but here his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:103342:51"/>rogative takes place, and there is room either to pardon or to puniſh as he pleaſes, without regard to any Law or Obligation. Mercy which is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxing of a Law, is due by no Law, if it were it would make void all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lawes, it would be not a relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or an abating of a Law, but a correcting all other Lawes by a Law that is ſuperiour to them, and ſo it would be an injury or a denying a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Right, not to grant it where that ſnperiour Law required it, but it is a pure, and arbitrary, and undue favour ſhown to one that has no manner of right or claim to it, which a ſupreme Governour, who has a Power para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to all Law, may by vertue of that, grant or deny by the meer mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and free inclination of his own good pleaſure. So that Mankind could not know that God would do this, would be ſo good as to forgive their wilful Sins and Offences againſt him from his Natural Goodneſs, nor could have any certain grounds to be aſſured of this, but by his own expreſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and poſitive declaration of this his free Grace and good Will towards them. They might have ſome faint
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:103342:51"/>hopes, and probable ſurmizes, and ſmall expectations of this from his Natural Goodneſs, as Malefactors may preſume and hope ſuch a thing from the temper and diſpoſition of a good Governour, but they could not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily conclude it, or be any way aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of it. They might have ſuch an uncertain encouragement to hope this, as the Men of <hi>Niniveh</hi> had, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.9. <hi>Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we periſh not;</hi> and this was as high as Mens hopes could riſe without a Revelation of Gods par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning them upon Repentance. Their Repentance indeed was the moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly means to turn away his fierce Anger, and the beſt thing they could do, but they could not be certain that this would ſucceed and be effectual, but in their greateſt Humiliation, and Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Faſting, they muſt with a doubtful Heart, and a trembling Hand, offer their Petitions to Heaven, as a condemned Priſoner does to his angry Judge or incenſed Prince, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether he will vouchſafe to hearken to it, or ſo much as to caſt his eye upon it. The greateſt incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:103342:52"/>to Repentance is our being ſure that it will obtain our Pardon, and reſtore us certainly to Favour, and ſet us right in the Court of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and ſince we that know this can yet very hardly be perſwaded to a Duty that is not ſo very pleaſant or ſo very eaſie, with what diſadvantages muſt thoſe who knew not this, be brought to it; with what deſponding fears and uncertain hopes muſt the Prodigal, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. take a weary jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and return home to his Fathers houſe, who knew not whether he ſhould be admitted or no when he came there; with what a doubtful and perplexed Mind, with what weary paces and diſpirited motions muſt he take every ſtep thither, when he could not tell what he ſhould meet with at his journeys end, but had too much reaſon to fear he ſhould for ever be caſt out and excluded, as he might have been by his <hi>good</hi> Father; and this muſt be the caſe of the moſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Sinner, and of all Mankind, when without a Revelation they had no aſſurance of Pardon, though upon their Repentance, but only an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hope and preſumption of it; but
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:103342:52"/>now the greateſt Sinner who has lived never ſo prodigally and wickedly, has a thouſand times greater incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to return, and leave off all his vicious and riotous courſes of living, becauſe he is moſt certainly aſſured that if he does ſo his Heavenly Father will receive him with open arms, and the heartieſt embraces, and treat him as kindly and indulgently <hi>as if he had ſerved him many years, neither had tranſgreſt at any time his commandment, ver.</hi> 29. In a word, we have the ſame incouragements to repent and leave our Sins now under the Goſpel, as Rebels have to come in and lay down their Arms when there is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of Pardon, and an Act of Indemnity paſt to all that do ſo, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before there was only an uncertain preſumption of the Princes Mercy, which they could not be ſure of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Revelation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We have not only Pardon given us upon promiſe now, but granted upon a moſt valuable conſideration, and founded upon a full Expiation of Guilt and Atonement of Sin by a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, the moſt perfect Sacrifice of the Son of God, and ſo purchaſed for
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:103342:53"/>us, and made over to us by a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant eſtabliſhed and confirmed by the Blood of Chriſt. Pardon of Sin is ſo great a thing, ſo Princely and ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular a favour, the greateſt Act in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that a Prince can do, and 'tis ſo deſirable, ſo comfortable to a poor Criminal, than which nothing in the World can be more valuable to him, that it can never be too well aſſured to us, and we can never be too much ſatisfied in it. Guilt is alwayes ſo fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and timorous, ſo terrible and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie a thing; 'tis ſuch a heavy load and burden lying upon a Mans Mind, ſuch a deep wound upon the tendereſt part of a Mans Soul, that like a prick upon a Nerve, it puts the whole Man into convulſions and agonies, and fills him with unexpreſſible pains and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. There is no ſuch rack, no ſuch Hell indeed, as what is ſet up and kindled in a Mans own breaſt by his guilty Conſcience, when he is haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his own Sins as ſo many Helliſh Fiends, and laſht by them like ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſnaky Furies, that poyſon and ſting him to the very Heart, and his own fears of Vengeance and future Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, repreſent ſad and frightful
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:103342:53"/>images, like to ſo many Specters, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes appearing before his Mind, and therefore there is no ſuch comfort as that which delivers us from Guilt, no ſuch <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or bleſſed news, as what our Saviour pronounces to a Sinner by the Goſpel, <hi>Son be of good chear, thy ſins are forgiven thee;</hi> there is no ſuch anodine as that which plucks out the <hi>ſting</hi> of Sin, and takes away the pains and the ſmartings of a wounded Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; that which does this puts not only Oyl into the Wounds, but new Life into the fainting Soul; 'tis like taking a Man off from the Rack or the Wheel, and giving him more eaſe than he feels when he has juſt voided a Stone after a ſharp fit. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Remedy that does this is the moſt choice, the moſt precious and valuable thing in the World: What that is we now know by the Goſpel, but Mankind could not know by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Light, what would expiate Sin, and certainly take away Guilt; and therefore the Heathens, though they tryed all means by their Luſtrations, Sacrifices, Purgations, and other ways, (for the ſenſe of their Guilt put them upon all attempts to get rid of it) yet
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:103342:54"/>they could never find what would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly do it, but muſt be ſtill fearful and melancholly under their acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Guilt and unattoned Crimes. Whether <hi>thouſand of rams, or ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand rivers of oyl</hi> would be accepted as a price of their Sins they could not tell, or whether it would not <hi>coſt more to redeem a Soul,</hi> whether if <hi>they brought their firſt-born, and offered the fruit of their Bodies for the ſin of their Souls,</hi> or offered up their own Blood as was ſometimes done, 'twould be effectual was very uncertain; but there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing they thought too dear it ſeems, nothing, however cruel either to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or others, that they would ſtick at in hopes to accompliſh this. The moſt barbarous and inhumane ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition of the Heathen World in offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their Children to <hi>Molech;</hi> in offering the Sacrifices of Men, which was no unuſual thing among them, aroſe from the great ſtreight and the great darkneſs they were in, as to the expiation of Guilt, and the atonement of Sin, which was ſo dreadful, ſo pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that they could not bear it, and yet knew not how to remove it. But now God be thanked, we have that
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:103342:54"/>which ſhould chear up our Spirits, and put us upon a hearty and a ſpeedy Repentance from all our Sins, becauſe upon our doing this, we have the <hi>Blood of Chriſt,</hi> and the Sacrifice of the <hi>Lamb of God,</hi> to deliver us from all Sin. That which the World was ſo anxiouſly, ſo concernedly, and yet ſo vainly ſeeking after before, that is only to be had and only made known by the Goſpel Revelation, the full and perfect, and certain Expiation of Guilt, which is the greateſt Argument and Encouragement to Repentance: for without that, 'tis not all our Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance will take away our paſt Guilt; 'tis not our greateſt ſorrow, or moſt penitent tears, will waſh away the ſtains and guilt of our Sins, unleſs they are mixt with, and have all their vertue from the Blood of Chriſt; and 'tis not they indeed, or any thing we can do, that has any proper vertue or efficacy to do this, but only the Sacrifice of Chriſt. Repentance is a neceſſary diſpoſition and qualification in us, without which no Sacrifice can be available to us, if it does not as the Scripture ſpeaks, <hi>Purge our Conſciences,</hi> and ſo purifie as well as atone, which
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:103342:55"/>is a ſtrong Conſideration to enforce this Duty, becauſe without it we loſe all the benefit of this Sacrifice; but 'tis not our Repentance that can either purchaſe, or procure, or pay for our Pardon, or that can any way challenge, or upon any account merit or pretend a right to it, be it never ſo exact; for by what rules of Juſtice does it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge our paſt arrears of wickedneſs, though we ſtop now and run no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on in the ſcore? What do we more by leaving our Sins, and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good now, than we ought always to have done, and always were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to? or how ſhall we make that which is paſt and done to be undone as it were, and the old account to be blotted out, and the paſt Guilt done away? 'Tis only the Meritorious Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Chriſt can do this, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God could do this without any Sacrifice I will not diſpute, becauſe I know not the Meaſures of the Divine Government, nor the Secrets of his Wiſdom and Counſel, but by a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it is much better obtained and aſſured to us, as being granted upon the account of ſomething that was given in ſtead of it, and that is worth
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103342:55"/>it indeed in fair Juſtice, for ſo was the Blood of the Son of God of equal va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue to the Souls of all Mankind, tho' I acknowledge it depends upon the free pleaſure of the Governour to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept or refuſe ſuch a ſatisfaction and compenſation as was made by that or by any Sacrifice, yet all this being tranſacted in ſuch a Method, being granted upon a valuable Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and being made over to us by a formal Covenant and ſtanding Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ratified and ſealed by the Blood of Chriſt, as well as a bare Promiſe: So that <hi>by all theſe immutable things in which it was impoſſible for God to lye, we might have ſtrong conſolation, Heb.</hi> 6.18. we have hereby the greateſt comfort, the higheſt ſatisfaction and aſſurance in the World given us, of that which we can never be too much aſſured of, and which is of the neareſt and cloſeſt concern to us in the World, the Pardon of our Sins, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation of all our Guilt, which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be had, and only fully diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Goſpel; and 'tis indeed the greateſt thing in which the Goſpel conſiſts, as 'tis different from Natural Religion.</p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:103342:56"/>
                  <p n="3">3. From hence, namely, from the Sacrifice and Death of Chriſt ariſe new Motives, and freſh and moſt endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Obligations to perfwade all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to repent and leave their Sins. The very Nature of a Sacrifice carries theſe in it, and was deſigned to offer the ſtrongeſt Motives againſt Sin at the ſame time that it procures Pardon for it. It is the wiſeſt expedient that could ever be thought of, to ſhow Juſtice and Severity, and yet Mercy and Clemency at the fame time; to put a Governour into thoſe two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Capacities, both at once to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, and yet to puniſh the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and to ſhow him to be neither too eaſie nor yet implacable, but by an admirable temper and mixture of two Vertues and two Paſſions that ſeem contrary to one another, it finds out a way to ſpare the Man, and yet ſhow the greateſt diſpleaſure to his Sin, neither to ſuffer the Guilty to periſh, nor yet the Guilt to be unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; ſo that hereby the greatneſs of the Guilt and the greatneſs of Gods Anger, is as viſible againſt the Sin in the ſufferings of the Sacrifice, as if the offender himſelf had ſuffered; and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:103342:56"/>we have Reaſons to dread it the more, even becauſe it is forgiven us; but we have ſtronger Reaſons, I think, to do this, out of gratitude to that dear Perſon who was pleaſed to become a Sacrifice for us, and from the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Love, and what he has done for us, we have moſt particular and ſtrong engagements to leave our Sins: For 'tis the higheſt ingratitude, and the moſt diſobliging thing to him that can be to continue in them, who ſuffered for this very end, <hi>that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and cleanſe us from all our ſins;</hi> 'tis a ſpoiling all his great undertaking for us, making void his Paſſion in effect, and making his Blood to be but like common Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpilt upon the ground, and yet 'tis a renewing his Paſſion at the ſame time, <hi>A crucifying to our ſelves the Son of God afreſh, and putting him to an open ſhame, Heb.</hi> 6.6. 'Tis like run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Spear again into his Side, making new Wounds in his Breaſt, and pricking him to the very Heart; 'tis doing that which is more diſpleaſing to him than his very Croſs, which he willingly underwent rather than we ſhould live and dye in our Sins. Look
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:103342:57"/>then, O unworthy and impenitent Chriſtian, upon thy Saviour offering up himſelf a Sacrifice for thee, and conſider what a mighty Argument his Death is to perſwade thee to Repent. Do not thy Sins look terrible when thou ſeeſt them through the Blood of Chriſt, and canſt thou have any hopes that God <hi>who ſpared not his own Son,</hi> will ſpare thee, if thou continueſt in them? And how great are the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of his Love, which are there written in his own Blood? and will not ſo much Love prevail upon thee to leave thy Sins, were there nothing elſe? How does thy dying Saviour, with his expanded Arms, and his Head hanging down, beſeech and intreat thee, and ſpeak to thee as it were from every gaping Wound in his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Body, to forſake and renounce thoſe Sins which crucified him, and for which he dyed? And if with the belief of a Chriſtian thou haſt but the Paſſions of a Man, this cannot but ſtrongly affect and move thee.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Chriſtianity and the Goſpel ſet forth and ſhew us the true Nature and Evil of our Sins, in a better light, and by greater conſiderations,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:103342:57"/>than Mankind had before; Sin was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes known to be a weakneſs and imperfection of our Nature, gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a low paſſion, a fooliſh humour, a ſilly cuſtom, acting in oppoſition to Reaſon, and doing things quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our own wiſe and calm thoughts, but by raſhneſs and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration doing that which we ſhall afterwards repent of, and condemn our ſelves for, and wiſh we had never done, and what we know will tend more to our miſchief and prejudice than any real good to us, only it pleaſes our fancy, and tickles our ſenſes, and is a little grateful to us at preſent; ſo that 'tis a ſort of Childiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and want of Underſtanding, and of Manly and Rational Government of our ſelves to yield to it, and be overcome by it, this it muſt appear to any thinking Man, to a Heathen and Philoſopher that conſidered the nature of things, and the difference of Good and Evil that aroſe from thence, and therefore that to repent of it was as neceſſary as for a Man to act wiſely and reaſonably, not to do what is weak and fooliſh, below the Nature and the Reaſon of a Man; but now

                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:103342:59"/>Chriſt, beſides all this, has repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sin in more ugly and frightful cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters by the Goſpel, as that which had thrown all Mankind into the moſt miſerable and loſt condition, as the <hi>work of the Devil which he came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy,</hi> as the device and ſtratagem of evil and malicious Spirits to deſtroy us, ſo that whenever we are drawn into Sin we are drawn in by the Devil, and uſed as tools by cunning infernal Fiends, who this way over-reach us, and ſport themſelves in our ruine and deſtruction; ſo that when we think we are enjoying our Pleaſures, and gratifying our Luſts, and uſing the freedoms and liberties of Humane Nature, we are but inveigled by thoſe Devils with the baits they lay for us, and the ſnares they every where ſet to entrap us, and are meer ſlaves and properties to their cunning and curſed deſigns upon us, ſo that Chriſt came to reſcue us from thoſe by calling us to Repentance, to reſcue us from the ſnares of the Devil, and redeem us from that ſervitude and ſlavery where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are led captive by him. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity better acquaints us alſo with the Nature of Sin and the Evils of it,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:103342:59"/>than Nature could by ſhowing us the ruins it had made upon Mankind, and the coſt and expences Heaven was at to repair Humane Nature; by letting us ſee the wretched and miſerable eſtate the Sins of Mankind had thrown them into irrecoverably without a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. Our Salvation by that ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous and myſterious way makes the greatneſs of our danger, and the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of our Sins, more evidently known to us, and the whole ſcheme and contrivance of it contains other conſiderations againſt Sin than Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Religion could ever have known or ſuggeſted; for by this Sin appears further to be ſo malignant and hateful to God, ſo deteſtable and odious in his ſight, and ſo contrary to his wiſe Government of the World, that he would not pardon it without the Blood of his own Son ſhed as an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for it, nor forgive it to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind without ſuch a valuable compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation and ſatisfaction made for it, as that was. Now this demonſtrates to us above any thing its abominable and diſpleaſing Nature to God, and that according to the wiſe Rules and Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes of his Government, by which
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:103342:60"/>he manages the World, it muſt ſuffer and be ſeverely puniſhed, and that there was no eſcaping of this but by an extraordinary contrivance of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom and Mercy, which found out a way by Jeſus Chriſt to ſave Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by Repentance. Sin is a greater debt, a more deep provocation to Heaven, a more horrid affront to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power and Authority, a more conſiderable injury to the good of the World, and to the Juſtice and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, than to be eaſily forgiven and paſſed by, as we find by the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of our Redemption, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of Chriſtianity, which ſhows us above any thing the Nature and Evil of it, and conſequently the great Reaſons of our Repenting from it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. As the Nature and Evil of Sin, fo the Conſequences and Puniſhments of it are greater by Chriſtianity; and Chriſt by the threatning of thoſe greater Judgments upon it has called us more loudly to Repentance. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the light of Reaſon taught all Mankind the preſent and Natural Evils that were like ſo many Curſes cleaving to Sin, like <hi>Hercules</hi> his poyſoned ſhirt clinging to it, and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:103342:60"/>ſticking faſt about it. God had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed a world of evils and miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous effects to Vice and Wickedneſs, by the original ſettlement and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental conſtitution of things; it was a diſeaſe to the Mind and a torment to the Conſcience, and very often a diſeaſe to the Body and rottenneſs to the Bones, a wound to a Mans Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and a blemiſh to his good Name, and an enemy to all his Intereſts, and to all his Happineſs in this World. Theſe plain and neceſſary effects of Sin Mankind could not but obſerve, as ſo many bitter Fruits naturally growing out of it as from a proper Root, and like ſo many plagues ſent from Heaven ſteeming out of this <hi>Pandora's</hi> box: And theſe Natural Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments of Sin, and the other as Natural Goods and Rewards of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, were the true ſanction of the Law of Nature. But beſides all theſe, there are a thouſand times greater and more additional evils ſuperadded to our Sins by Chriſtianity, if we do not in time Repent of them; there are the poſitive and eternal evils of Sin in another World; for I can by no means call the Torments of Hell Natural,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:103342:61"/>which God has revealed to us by the Goſpel. How little theſe were known to the World before, I might ſhow from the odd fancies of the wiſeſt Heathens about the tranſmigration of Souls, and the revolution of all things within ſuch a period of years; and whatever gueſs they had rather than belief of Puniſhments for Sin in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, yet that they ſhould be ſo great as the Scripture now repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents them, and that they ſhould be Eternal, which is the moſt dreadful part of them, this can only be known from the Revelation and Will of God, who may continue our being, and lengthen or ſhorten our duration to what time he pleaſes, and therefore as Chriſt <hi>has brought Life and Immortality to light by the goſpel,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. ſo in like manner he has brought Hell and Damnation, and revealed ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable and greater Puniſhments to Sin than the World knew before, as cannot but fright the moſt daring Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and make the fondeſt Senſualiſt part with his Luſts, when he conſiders that all their tempting charms, and enticing gayety, and momentany plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, ſhall end in nothing but Helliſh
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:103342:61"/>torments, unquenchable flames, and eternal howlings and gnaſhings of teeth, which muſt be owned to be a thouſand times greater than all the known, and viſible, and Natural Evils of Sin.</p>

                  <p>NOW becauſe this is the greateſt determent from Sin imaginable, and conſequently the greateſt motive to Repentance that can poſſibly be given; for nothing is ſo ſtrong and powerful upon moſt Men as their fears, which is the quickeſt and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Paſſion in Humane Nature, and is apt to make a very great impreſſion where nothing elſe will, and nothing can be ſo much an object of our fear, as Hell and Eternal Miſery, which is the utmoſt and moſt dreadful Evil that can be either felt or imagined. I ſhall particularly and largely offer and repreſent it to the Sinners thoughts, both as to its Nature, conſiſting in the greateſt pains and torments of Body
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:103342:62"/>and Mind, and in the moſt wretched and miſerable ſtate and condition, and as all this is Eternal and ſhall never have end: Both which, if heartily believ'd and ſeriouſly conſider'd, would have a mighty power and almoſt irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible force to bring Men off from their greateſt Sins.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Then let us conſider its Nature, as conſiſting of the greateſt pains and torments both of Body and Mind, and in the moſt wretched and miſerable ſtate and condition. I ſhall not attempt fully to deſcribe, or draw a picture of this place of Torments, our imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is to be help'd out with all the known inſtances of Miſery, and ſo to form an Idea of that future, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, and inviſible one: It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it muſt be adapted to thoſe two parts of which we conſiſt, our Bodies and our Minds, and what are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Evils to either of thoſe we very well know, ſenſible Pain and great Anguiſh and Sorrow, and other tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting Paſſions, and theſe we muſt ſuppoſe in the higheſt degree to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Helliſh Miſery; for as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is the utmoſt good our Natures
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:103342:62"/>can poſſibly receive, and are capable of, ſo Hell is the greateſt evil, and as ſuch is repreſented to us by that Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which aſſures us of it, attended with the moſt ſad and woful circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that can be imagined. I ſhall offer the thoughts of it to the Sinner under ſuch Ideas and Repreſentations as are given of it by the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture. And</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We muſt conceive a horrid, dark and diſmal dungeon in ſome deep ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern of the Earth, deſigned for hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and fill'd with the blackneſs of darkneſs, and inhabited only by cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Fiends, and frightful Ghoſts and Devils, into which the wretched Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff is to be thrown, <hi>bound hand and foot, and ſo caſt into outer darkneſs, Matth.</hi> 22.13. and <hi>delivered into chains of darkneſs,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. Darkneſs is the Natural image and ſymbol of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and diſconſolateneſs, as Light is of comfort and pleaſantneſs; ſo that the Scripture expreſſes Happineſs by the <hi>dwelling in light,</hi> as it does Miſery by <hi>being caſt into outer darkneſs,</hi> where there is not any beam of light, nor any the leaſt glimpſe of joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. And thus to be ſhut up for ever
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:103342:63"/>in a place of darkneſs and horrour, and confined to this diſmal and infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Priſon to all Eternity, would be a dreadful Miſery were there nothing elſe, but they are to be tormented there as well as impriſoned, and that with the moſt exquiſite pains and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as they are deſcribed to us, in the ſecond place.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By Fire and Burning, which is the moſt terrible, the moſt keen and painful of Bodily puniſhments, which enters the tender parts with pointed and piercing fury, and diſſolves and diſtorts them with its rapid motion, and has nothing to abate its extreme cruelty, but that it quickly conſumes and diſpatches, and ſpends it ſelf with its own rage and violence, as well as deſtroyes its ſubject. But this is the dreadful Nature of that infernal Fire, that it never goes out, but is, as the Scripture calls it, <hi>unquenchable,</hi> and that the miſerable wretches that are condemned to it, ſhall endure the pain and the rage of it for ever, and ſhall never be conſumed or deſtroyed by it, but ſhall be <hi>tormented with fire and brimſtone in the preſence of the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and in the preſence of the Lamb,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:103342:63"/>and the ſmoke of their torment aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up for ever and ever, and they have no reſt day nor night, Rev.</hi> 14.10, 11. Let us then ſet before us a burning Lake of liquid Fire and melted Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, like <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> fiery Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, heat ſeven times hotter than any thing we here know, and the damned wretches caſt into it, and like <hi>Dives</hi> ſadly tormented in thoſe flames over all their parts, ſo that the Tongue is ſwelled with heat as in a raging Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and nothing would be ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to it as a drop of Water to cool it, and to ſlake and abate the ſcorching Calenture. Some are incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to think all this but Allegory and Metaphor, and painted Fire, but the Scripture ſpeaks ſo often of it, that I cannot but think it may be literally true, and that Fire is made the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe Bodily pains that are there to be ſuffered and inflicted after the general Judgment and Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Or however that as great pains of Body are thereby ſignified and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, and ſhall really be endured ſome way or other, as by burning in Fire: For if the Holy Spirit to help our weak thoughts, and aſſiſt our imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:103342:64"/>has made uſe of thoſe known things only as emblems and pictures of ſome real pains, yet they are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly as great or greater than any of thoſe by which they are ſhadowed out and repreſented, as the pleaſure of Heaven is much greater, no doubt, and does far exceed that of a Feaſt, a Wedding, a Crown, or any ſuch Earthly reſemblance. As to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per pain and torment of the Mind, which is the other, and the greateſt part of Helliſh Miſery, for the Mind has a more quick, and keen, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſenſe than the Body, that is repreſented in Scripture by <hi>the worm which never dyes, Matth.</hi> 9.46. <hi>i. e.</hi> by a Paſſion that bites, and gnaws, and corrodes, and pains us within, as the Fire, or ſomething elſe, torments the Body from without, and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes in it all thoſe diſmal and reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoughts and apprehenſions which the Mind has upon its dreadful ſtate and condition. As,</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) A direful perception of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Anger, Wrath and Diſpleaſure, which when it lyes heavy upon the Mind in the higheſt degree, will preſs it into the deepeſt gulph of Miſery,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:103342:64"/>and fill it with the moſt terrible Ideas, and moſt dreadful apprehenſions. Even in this World, when a Sinner taſts but a little of the Cup of Gods Fury, 'tis <hi>a cup of trembling, and a cup of aſtoniſhment,</hi> as the Scripture calls it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.17. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23.32. and what will it then be when all the dregs of it muſt be drunk up! When God hides his Face but a little, there is all trouble and horrour, and what muſt it then be when he hides it for ever! The ſenſe and apprehenſion of lying under the diſpleaſure of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Power, and provoked Juſtice, and abuſed Goodneſs, and all theſe highly incenſed againſt a Man, and never to be appeaſed, muſt be very dreadful, and make ſad impreſſions upon the Mind, The Preſence and the Favour of God giveth Life and Comfort, what Death and Miſery muſt it then be to be baniſhed for ever from both, with a <hi>Depart from me ye ourſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) The Mind will reflect upon what is paſt with infinite remorſe and anguiſh, and with great regret curſe its own folly and madneſs that has brought it to this ſad condition, when God had put it in its power to have
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:103342:65"/>made it ſelf for ever happy, had it been wiſe and conſidering as it ought to have been. This will be the great ſting of its Miſery, that it wilfully brought it upon it ſelf, and for a few fooliſh, and raſh, and finful actions, undid it ſelf for ever, and for ſome trifling reaſons and pitiful temptations, the little pleaſures or profits of Sin, which are now all gone, made it ſelf thus wretchedly and eternally miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. How with rage and envy will it look up to that Happineſs it has loſt, and ſees others enjoy, and vex it ſelf with fury that it ſhould refuſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that when it was offered to it; and this one thought will double and increaſe its Miſery, and make it curſe and tear it ſelf, that it was its own choice.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) As the Mind with looking back will be filled with remerſe and anguiſh upon its paſt Sins and paſt Madneſs, ſo by looking forward, and ſeeing no end of the Miſery it is in, it will be filled and overwhelmed with Deſpair, which is a Paſſion of Mind ſo perfectly and ſo unſpeakably miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that I ſhall not venture to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it, for 'tis beyond any thing we
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:103342:65"/>can imagine, and it properly belongs to the next head, which is the eternity and endleſs duration of theſe Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Miſery, which though it be but a circumſtance of time, and not properly that wherein they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, yet is the moſt dreadful perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and completion of them, which I ſhall conſider by and by.</p>
                  <p>Let us now but ſeriouſly think with our ſelves what a dreadful ſtate it is to be under all this torment of Mind, and pain of Body, to lye thus upon the rack of the greateſt tortures both from within and without, and that in ſuch extremity that they ſhall make dreadful and hideous ſigns and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of it, in <hi>weeping, and mourning, and lamentation, and gnaſhing of teeth, Matth:</hi> 22.13. when <hi>they ſhall gnaw their tongues for pain, and blaſpheme the God of heaven, becauſe of their pains, Rev.</hi> 16.10, 11. And yet all their bitter cryes and dolorous excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations ſhall only blow up and kindle the rage and fury of the ſurrounding flames, for none of their ſighs ſhall put out, nor their tears extinguiſh any the leaſt ſpark of thoſe flames which are kindled by the Wrath of God,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:103342:66"/>who is a <hi>conſuming fire.</hi> Who can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs or imagine the keenneſs and ſharpneſs of thoſe pains of Body, or the pangs and agonies of Conſcience, the paſſions, and anguiſh, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of Mind, and nothing to take off, or divert, or give the leaſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to all theſe, but an angry God above, a dark and bottomleſs pit of burning Brimſtone below, and fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ugly, and inſulting Spirits, like ſo many executioners, all about it, and no friend to call to, to pity or to help it.</p>
                  <p>O ſad, and miſerable, and intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition! Who would not do all he could to warn others and himſelf that they come not to that place of Torments? What pleaſure or profit can there be in the moſt tempting Sin, that ſhould make a Man venture the enduring all this for the ſake of it? Who would endure this but one day, or one month, for all the things this World can afford? Who would ſuffer it for ſo long a time as this life of Sin here laſts for all that he gets by it? Who would endure it a thouſand years for all the Kingdoms of this World, and the Glories thereof, much leſs

                  <p n="2">II. This is Eternal, and ſhall never have end. This is the dreadful and amazing circumſtance of this Miſery, and that which muſt confound him that ſuffers it, that it ſhall laſt for ever, ſo that there ſhall never be any hopes of having an end of it, after ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo many thouſand years, but there ſhall be ſtill an infinite Eternity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and ſo as much as there was at the firſt beginning. Who can think of this without the utmoſt horrour, and amazement, and having his thoughts ſwallowed up with the dreadful conſideration of it? It is ſo great that ſome have had their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon overcome and overwhelmed by it, ſo that they have thought it unagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and inconſiſtent with Gods Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Juſtice, to inflict ſo long and ſo great a Miſery upon any of his Creatures, and have therefore endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to limit this Eternity to a ſhorter compaſs of time, and not to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:103342:67"/>extend it to an abſolute but a limited Eternity, as ſometimes it is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in Scripture, and therefore to reconcile all thoſe places of Scripture to this notion of it, and to interpret them ſo, that Eternity in the fulleſt and utmoſt ſenſe may not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by them. I ſhall therefore briefly examine this Argument, which on the one ſide ſeems very careful of the credit and honour of the Divine Juſtice and Goodneſs, but on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther takes off extremely from the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt terrour of Helliſh Torments, in denying them to be Eternal, ſo that it may tend in great meaſure to take off the power and force of thoſe which are the greateſt reſtraints that God could lay upon Sin and Wickedneſs; and ſince ſo few are prevailed upon by them, though under the doctrine and perſwaſion of their being Eternal, how much fewer would be ſo if they thought them otherwiſe.

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> How 'tls agreeable to Gods Goodneſs to puniſh the few Sins of a ſhort Life with ſuch great and never ending Torments, when in all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and all diſtributions of Juſtice, the Puniſhment ought not to be ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportioned, and ſo much greater than the Crime. And beſides, how a good, and tender, and pitiful God, ſhould keep a poor Creature in being for ever, meerly to let it ſuffer, and be miſerable, and endure infinite Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. To this I anſwer briefly;
<list>
                        <item>1. Whatever Puniſhment is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſecure the ends of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to preſerve Obedience to Laws, and to keep bold and daring Men from breaking and violating them; whatever is neceſſary to this end is juſt, and neceſſary, and agreeable both to the Goodneſs, and Wiſdom, and Juſtice of the beſt Government; for otherwiſe, there muſt be no ſuch thing as Government in the World, but God muſt give up his Authority, and throw the reins looſe upon the necks of his Creatures, if he have not a power to threaten and inflict ſuch Puniſhments as ſhall be ſufficient to deter Men from Diſobedience, and to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:103342:68"/>reſtrain them from Wickedneſs. Now we eaſily ſee to how little purpoſe a leſs Puniſhment would ferve then that of Hell to thoſe ends, ſince there are ſo few awed even by that, tho' God has ſo ſeverely threatned it. If then, for the ends of Government, and for publick good, ſuch a Puniſhment as this be neceſſary, it is conſiſtent both with Juſtice and Goodneſs however fevere it be, for this is the only juſt meaſure and proportion of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that they be able to attain their end, and the Rule of Juſtice is to be taken not from any private but pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Reaſons.</item>
                        <item>2. God has given us free choice, and propoſed both Eternal Happineſs, and Eternal Miſery to us; <hi>He hath ſet before us life and death, Deut.</hi> 30.15. ſo that if we obey him, and live wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vertuouſly, we ſhall enjoy the one, but if we chooſe Sin, we chooſe Death with it, and our deſtruction is of our ſelves, and we <hi>judge our ſelves unworthy of everlaſting life, Acts</hi> 13.46. as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> told the <hi>Jews.</hi> Gods propoſing ſuch vaſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments, as 'tis per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a neceſſary ſanction of his Laws,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:103342:68"/>ſo 'tis perfectly our own fault and madneſs, if we refuſe the one and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur the other.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall ſhow how this Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is clearly and undeniably proved from Scripture, which it ſeems to be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the word Eternal and Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and what amounts to that, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes uſed upon this account, as <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire, Matth.</hi> 25.41. and <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting burnings, Iſa.</hi> 33.14. and <hi>the fire that is unquenchable, and that never goes out, Mark</hi> 9.46. <hi>Luke</hi> 3.17. But to this they ſay, that the word Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal is often uſed in Scripture in a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited ſenſe, according to the nature of the thing to which it belongs; as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prieſthood is called an <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Prieſthood, Exod.</hi> 40.15. and their Law of Atonement is called an <hi>everlaſting ſtatute, Lev.</hi> 16.34. tho' neither were to be ſo ſtrictly, nor to laſt longer than the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> oeconomy: So <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> and the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties about them, are ſaid <hi>to ſuffer the vengeance of eternal fire,</hi> in <hi>ver.</hi> 7. of St. <hi>Judes</hi> Epiſtle, becauſe it brought eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſtruction to them, though there be now none of that fire remaining, ſo ſhall the fire of Hell, ſay they, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:103342:69"/>and annihilate the wicked, and ſo as the Scripture ſpeaks, bring ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting death and deſtruction upon them, though if that ſhall laſt Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, yet they ſhall not be Eternally tormented in it.</p>
                  <p>Now in reply to this, I own, that the word <hi>Eternal</hi> and <hi>for ever,</hi> is often uſed in a limited ſenſe, but that it cannot be ſo when it is ſpoken here of Helliſh Torments, there is this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that the ſame word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which is ſpoken of Eternal Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is ſpoken alſo of Eternal Life, ſo that if it be underſtood of a limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Eternity in the one, it muſt be ſo in the other, which no body ever held or ſuppoſed, and yet there is as much Reaſon from hence to deny the abſolute Eternity of Heaven, as the abſolute Eternity of Hell</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That they ſuffer Eternal Death, and are Eternally deſtroyed, is not to be underſtood in a ſtrict and literal ſenſe, ſo that they loſe all Being, but yet are not Eternally tormented is plain from thoſe places where it is ſaid, <hi>They have no reſt day nor night, Rev.</hi> 14.11. which ſuppoſes them not to be in a ſtate of non-exiſtence, but of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:103342:69"/>actual pain. 'Tis ſaid there alſo, that <hi>they ſhall be tormented with fire and brimſtone,</hi> and that <hi>the ſmoke of their torment aſcendeth up for ever and ever, ver.</hi> 10.11. which can never without violence be underſtood of the Fire which ſtill laſts, and which they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be Eternal, whilſt they are not tormented in it, but deſtroyed by it, though it remains ſtill as a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods Juſtice and Vengeance upon Sinners, for the <hi>ſmoke of their torment aſcending for ever,</hi> ſuppoſes them to be for ever tormented, and <hi>their having no reſt night nor day,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily implyes this. Beſides, as it is ſaid, <hi>The fire is not quenched, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver goes out;</hi> ſo it is ſaid alſo, that <hi>their worm never dyes.</hi> Now though the Fire might poſſibly continue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its proper ſubject, yet the Worm there meant never can, for that is only that anguiſh, and remorſe, and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious reflection of Mind, which if it never dye, the ſubject of it muſt laſt, and continue, and ſuffer it for ever. So that though our <hi>Socinian</hi> Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries avoid the other places of Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Puniſhment, and Everlaſting and Unquenchable Fire, with ſome
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:103342:70"/>Art and Sophiſtry, yet they can never evade thoſe of <hi>the worms never dying, and of the ſmoke of their torments go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up for ever, and their having no reſt day nor night, Rev.</hi> 14.11.</p>
                  <p>But not to diſpute further of theſe matters, let the Sinner ſeriouſly conſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and meditate of theſe infinitely great, and infinitely laſting and never ending Torments. If there be ſuch a thing as Hell, it concerns him highly to Repent, and ſo take care to avoid it. If he do not think this to be true, but ſecretly disbelieve it, he muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe all Religion, and all Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and run into the utmoſt madneſs of Scepticiſm and Atheiſm; and then let him conſider, that 'tis not his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief makes things to be true or falſe, but whatever he thinks of them, they are and will be what they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and 'tis certain he can never know them to be falſe, however he is inclined to believe them ſo; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were they never ſo uncertain, and were it but merely probable, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed poſſible, that there ſhould be any ſuch thing, yet no Man in his wits ſhould run the venture, and lye open to ſo prodigious and dreadful an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:103342:70"/>as an Eternity of Miſery. But to ſuch Chriſtians that firmly believe them, and have all Reaſon ſo to do both from Revelation and Reaſon too, for all Mankind had ever ſome belief and expectations of ſad Puniſhments in another World for Wickedneſs, to them 'tis unaccountable folly and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to live in ſuch Sins, and in ſuch courſes, as will throw them into this unquenchable Fire, and conſign them to this dreadful and everlaſting ſtate of Miſery. Is there any Sin whoſe charms are ſo great, whoſe gains are ſo tempting, that for the enjoyment of all theſe for a little ſeaſon, 'tis worth enduring the Torments of Hell for ever?</p>
                  <p>If theſe <hi>Terrors of the Lord</hi> will not perſwade Men to Repent and Leave their Sins, nothing will. Yet there is one or two other Motives or Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Repentance from Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which I muſt propoſe after this of Hell, and all the reſt, namely,</p>

                  <p n="6">6. ANother Motive which may be ſaid to be peculiar to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and which ſhould encourage to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance above all others, is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Divine Grace and Holy Spirit to enable us to peform it, to aſſiſt us to overcome all our evil Habits, and to maſter all the Corruptions and Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of Humane Nature, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer all thoſe Sins that are thought never ſo difficult, or even inſuperable to Fleſh and Blood, and to practice all thoſe Vertues that are moſt contrary to our Natural Temper or Senſual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations. Be there never ſo many Arguments to the doing of a thing, and never ſo much danger in not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, be it never ſo great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, or never ſo neceſſary, yet if after all a Man be without power and without ability to do it, they will be all in vain, and to no more purpoſe, than to perſwade a blind Man to ſee by the conveniency of that Senſe, or a lame Man to run by the danger he
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:103342:71"/>may otherwiſe be in, or a Man tumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from a precipice to ſtop before he falls to the bottom, 'tis only to mock and deride us with Motives and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to a thing, if it be wholly out of our power to effect it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no ſuch Motive to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thing that we are otherwiſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded is of great moment and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, as to be aſſured of ſufficient power to enable us to go through with it, without which all our Vigour will be dampt, and all the ſinews of Induſtry cut, and all our Endeavours blaſted, by which we ſhould ſet about it, and we ſhall run the Cenſure of thoſe fooliſh undertakers our Saviour ſpeaks of, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. who would make War, or build a Tower, without power to go on with it. God has therefore given us the greateſt Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement by the Goſpel, that can be to ſet upon the practice, as of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Duties, ſo eſpecially of this hard one of Repentance, when he thereby aſſures us, that his <hi>Grace ſhall be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for us,</hi> that <hi>he worketh in us both to will and to do,</hi> that <hi>his Spirit ſhall be given us, and abide with us for ever, and that we ſhall be mightily ſtrengthened
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:103342:72"/>by it in the inner man;</hi> ſo that a new, and ſtrong, and vital Principle, ſhall be added to Humane Nature to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then its weakneſs, repair its decayes, recruit its forces, ſupport its feeble powers, raiſe its ſunk ſtate, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it to the Vertue and Perfection it had loſt by its Sins. How weak and decayed, how corrupted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated Humane Nature was of its ſelf, both Scripture and our own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience do ſufficiently teach us; how ſtrong and violent our Paſſions are, and how weak our Reaſon to maſter and govern them; how prone the Will is to conſent to what is evil be it but a little grateful to Fleſh and Blood, and what ſtrong proclivities and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations are in us to many Sins. The Heathens were very ſenſible of this corruption and decay of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and into what a low and dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate ſtate it was ſunk, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they complained very often of the <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:103342:72"/>not find out; they felt how ſtrong were the propenſions to Vice, and how the Mind <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as <hi>Hierocles</hi> ſpeaks, was carried by its Paſſions, like ſo many weights hanging upon it, and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it to Sin, and what ſhould bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance theſe, what ſhould turn and counterpoize thoſe propenſities and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, what ſhould bear up againſt all the Corruptions from within, and the Temptations from without, and relieve and ſuccour the weak forces of decayed Nature that was ſo ſtrongly beſieged, and ſo little able to hold out of it ſelf, this they could not know; for 'tis only by the Goſpel and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity that we have the Promiſe of Gods Grace and Holy Spirit to be given to us when we ask it, and to belong as a right to all Chriſtians by vertue of the New Covenant, and be a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Principle to prevent and reſtrain us from Sin, and work Holineſs and Vertue in our Minds. And now by vertue of this we have the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to Repent and Leave our Sins, which is a Power to do ſo. We have a new Principle of Life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed into our Souls, and a freſh, and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:103342:73"/>Heavenly, and almoſt a miraculous Power given to us, by which <hi>the Lame may walk, and the Lepers be cleanſed; i. e.</hi> by which thoſe who are Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Impotent may be enabled to do their Duty, and the greateſt Sinners may be cured of their fouleſt Sins. All the Excuſes which were more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and plauſible heretofore of the weakneſs and impotency of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of the ſtrength and power of our Corruptions, of the neceſſity and unavoidableneſs of our ſinful Actions, are now quite taken away by this Divine Grace and Aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt which the Goſpel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and beſtowes upon us. By this the greateſt Sin may be conquered, the ſtrongeſt Luſt and Temptation over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and the longeſt Habit and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom changed and broken, ſo that no Sinner ſhould be diſcouraged from breaking off his Sins by Repentance, by reaſon of the difficulty or impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of it, ſince no Sin is too ſtrong for the Grace of God, but we can in every thing be <hi>more than conquerours through him which ſtrengtheneth us,</hi> and <hi>greater is he that is in us, than he that is in the world,</hi> than the Devil or any
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:103342:73"/>Sin that we ſhall be in danger of, which can never take ſuch poſſeſſion of any Soul, as not to be caſt out by the Power and Spirit of Chriſt. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hard it is to overcome a long Cuſtom, and root out an ill Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to reſtrain and check an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled Luſt and Appetite that has too long had the reins thrown upon its neck, yet a firm Reſolution, ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with the Divine Grace and Aſſiſtance of Heaven, will be able even to <hi>quicken and raiſe thoſe who are dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, to create them again in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, and to renew them again unto Repentance, Heb.</hi> 6.6. That Luſt which we thought was ſo violent that all the force of Reaſon could not ſtand againſt it, that Temptation which we called irreſiſtible, that Cuſtom and Habit which we imagined incurable, that Vice which we counted too hard for Fleſh and Blood to deny, theſe may all be certainly, not to ſay eaſily, overcome by the Divine Grace, if we will make uſe of it. Let the greateſt Sinner therefore, with the Power of Chriſt and the auxillary forces of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſet upon his ſtrongeſt Sins, let
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:103342:74"/>him but boldly and reſolutely fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and he ſhall find they will give ground, and in a little time their power will abate, and he will, by the help of God and his own conſtant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, obtain a full and a perfect victory over them. God will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, without our own endeavours and cooperation, do the whole work for us, nor will his Spirit work upon us, as if we were Machines, and had not internal powers and principles of action within our ſelves, by an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible force and impulſe which ſhall do all this in an inſtant, and convert a Sinner in a moment. No, this muſt be done gradually and ſucceſſively, by the bringing in of other thoughts, diſpoſitions, inclinations and practices, by a kindly and gentle influence upon our Minds, the Spirit deſcending like rain, or ſhedding its Vertue like dew upon our Hearts, and ſo bringing forth the fruits of Repentance in us, not like a violent ſtream or a mighty torrent, bearing down all immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before it. The Spirit of God, which is compared in Scripture to the winds blowing, where we ſee the effects though we diſcern not the cauſe, does
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:103342:74"/>not by a ſudden guſt, like a hurricane, convert a Sinner, and turn him from his Sins, in ſuch a manner as a tree is torn up by the roots with a violent tempeſt, but by a freſh and gentle gale it carries the Sinner from Vice to Vertue, by filling his Mind with new thoughts, and ſtrongly moving and determining him the right way, and ſecretly inclining his Mind to chooſe, and his Underſtanding to ſee and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what is his true Intereſt and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and by an inward energy and vertue, as a principle of Life, acts ſecretly and undiſcernably upon all our Faculties, changing our thoughts, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and affections, and working up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Minds, though in a way agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our Rational Faculties, yet by a Power ſuperiour and ſuperadded to them.</p>
                  <p>And now let every Sinner conſider what great Motives and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſo what Obligations he hath to Repent by the Goſpel, how powerfully and how endearingly, by Motives both of Love and Fear, Chriſt doth there <hi>call Sinners to Repentance.</hi> It was his great work, and for this purpoſe he came into the World, to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:103342:75"/>recover loſt and undone Mankind, and to reſcue them from that ſtate of Sin and Miſery they were in, and to reſtore them to a ſtate of Vertue and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This was a deſign worthy Chriſts coming into the World, and all the myſterious diſpenſation of Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And this is of ſuch abſolute neceſſity and importance to us, that 'tis impoſſible we can otherwiſe eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape Miſery, and not periſh inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably. God when he would ſhow the greateſt Mercy and Kindneſs to us in the World, and demonſtrate his Love to us in the higheſt manner, as he hath done by the Goſpel, yet hath there told us, that <hi>except we repent we ſhall all certainly periſh, Luke</hi> 13.5. This is the perpetual and indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition, upon which alone we muſt expect any benefit by Chriſt and the Goſpel, this is as low as God can go with us. Perfect and uninterrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Obedience all our lives is his due, and when we have broken that, and he compounds with us, and accepts of Partial and Renewed Obedience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Entire, <hi>i. e.</hi> of Repentance, and returning to our Duty inſtead of keeping alwayes to it; this is the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:103342:75"/>favour can be expected from him or that he can grant to us, and Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is the only way by which it is poſſible for a Sinner to eſcape Wrath and Damnation. This I ſhall a little clear, and make out, and then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade to this Duty of Repentance from the abſolute neceſſity of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then, 'tis this alone can conſiſt with the Wiſdom and Honour of God, as he is Governour of the World. God as he is a Being of Infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Compaſſion to his Creatures, ſo he is a very Wiſe and Prudent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the World, and therefore though, like a merciful Prince, out of the Goodneſs of his Nature, and the tender Inclinations he has for all his Subjects, he is ready to ſhew all Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Clemency to thoſe that have offended him, yet if he ſhould do this too eaſily, without any ſecurity of their good behaviour for the future, or any care and proviſion for their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Obedience, it would not a little reflect upon the Wiſdom of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and repreſent him as too ſoft and eaſie a Being, and render his Authority in time cheap and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible. It would not only looſen the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:103342:76"/>reins of Government, but be a letting them go out of his hands, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them upon the necks of his inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and rebellious Vaſſals, if without any tyes or obligations for the future, or letting them know upon what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions they ſhould be capable of his favour and continue in it, he ſhould take off all the Puniſhment their paſt Crimes had deſerved, this would be to encourage them to commit new ones, and give them juſt grounds to hope for an abſolute and perpetual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity. Should God have granted by the Goſpel, or any other way, ſuch an Unconditional Charter of Mercy and Pardon, this would have certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroyed that very Power by which he granted it, and ſuch a Privilege or Conceſſion as it would greatly have reflected upon his Honour, ſo it would have quite undermined his Authority; it would have been a reſigning up his Throne, and a laying his Crown at the feet of his own inſolent Rebels. For what would have remain'd to him of Power to Govern or to Puniſh, if he had done this? If he had ſet out a ſtanding Act of Grace and Mercy to all Sinners, without any Condition or
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:103342:76"/>Proviſo that they turn from their Wickedneſs which they had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they ſhould come in and lay down all their Hoſtile Weapons, and be Faithful and Loyal hereafter, or elſe be utterly uncapable of any bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of it: Without this it had been rather a Diſpenſation, or Indulgence to be Wicked, than a wiſe Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mercy to ſerve the true Ends and Intereſt of Government. God indeed has with great Wiſdom and Goodneſs found out ſuch a temper in his Government, and contrived ſuch an expedient, as ſhews the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Wiſdom and the moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Mercy both together, and that is, for the ſake and by the mediation of a Sacrifice to pardon, and yet to puniſh the Sinner, by the ſame way to give an inſtance of his Mercy and a remonſtrance of his Juſtice; and the deſign of all that is to ſhow, that though he is the moſt inclined to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Clemency, yet he will never ſhow it but in ſuch a way as is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the Honour and Wiſdom of his Government. He is willing to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of his extream Right over his Creatures, and to take off the edge
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:103342:77"/>and ſeverity of his Laws, ſo far as Prudence and the Wiſe Ends of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment will give leave, but not ſo far as ſhall give any manner of encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to Diſobedience and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and that would be unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, if he ſhould ever grant a Pardon to wicked Men upon any other condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than turning away from their Wickedneſs</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As 'tis this alone can conſiſt with the Honour and Wiſdom of God, as he is a wiſe Governour, ſo nothing but this can render us acceptable to him, as he is a truly Righteous and Holy Being. If we conſider God as ſuch, as a Being eſſentially holy, ſo that this is not only his Perfection but his very Nature, then it can never be imagined that he can have any love or kindneſs, or ſhow any favour to a wicked Man, till he has turned away from his Wickedneſs. What is ſo contrary to himſelf he can never love, if he love himſelf, for he might by the ſame reaſon as well hate himſelf as love that. The love of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not upon any particular arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary inclination, or unaccountable humour and fancy, as in weak Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:103342:77"/>but it ariſes from his own Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Excellencies and Perfections, and is grounded upon a true and a laſting Principle, his own Nature rather than his Will: So that whilſt God himſelf is unchangeably holy, he will alwayes love any Soul that is truly holy, and comes up to his original Holineſs by ſuch meaſures and proportions as its Nature will admit, but whilſt the Mind continues wicked, it can never by any means in the World be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God, 'tis alienated from him, 'tis oppoſite to his Nature, and 'tis therefore the neceſſary object of his hatred and diſpleaſure, or as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks, <hi>An abomination to him.</hi> Sin is the only thing that God hates, and the only cauſe why he is angry and diſpleaſed with any of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and as long as this remains there is an everlaſting breach, and a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ground and foundation of enmity between them, and not only Light and Darkneſs, but Heaven and Hell are more irreconcilable than a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God and a Wicked Soul. All the Sacrifices that can be offered to atone and expiate for ſuch an one, if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues ſuch, were they never ſo rich,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:103342:78"/>or never ſo many, can no more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to God, or make its peace with him, than all the Bribes and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents of the <hi>Indies</hi> could pervert a Juſt and Righteous Judge, or blind the eyes of Juſtice and Integrity it ſelf. There can never be any other terms of Reconciliation between a Wicked Soul and a Righteous God, but only this, that it become Righteous, and till it do ſo, it can never become the object of Gods Love and Favour, unleſs he change his own Righteous Nature, and ceaſe to be Righteous and Holy himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Without this we can never be freed from the Natural and Neceſſary Evils of Sin upon our Minds, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it will make us inwardly miſerable till we are cured of them; for though we ſhould ſuppoſe all the Political Evils, as I may call them, of Sin ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away and removed, <hi>i. e.</hi> all that outward Miſchief and Puniſhment which is to be inflicted upon it from the Arbitrary Will and Threatning of the ſovereign Lawgiver, though he ſhould out of tenderneſs and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or for the ſake of a Sacrifice or other Conſideration, abate of that,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:103342:78"/>and not execute the utmoſt Penalties, and thoſe poſitive Severities that he had denounced againſt it, yet ſo many are the Natural Evils that are annex'd to it, that it would of it ſelf make the Mind neceſſarily and inwardly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable. This does not depend upon the Will of God as a Governour only, but as a Creator, as he hath ſetled and ordered the nature of things, and made it impoſſible they ſhould ever be otherwiſe. Miſery is ſo entailed to Sin by the fundamental conſtitution of things, that 'tis impoſſible ever to cut it off. It is as inſeparable from, and as cloſely connected to it as effects are to their cauſes; and we may as well divorce Light from the Sun, or Heat from Fire, as Miſery from Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It ſprings out of it Naturally, as a foul ſtream from ſuch a corrupt fountain, growes upon it as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and bitter fruit from ſuch a poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous root, and Sin as a true Parent has the ſeeds of all Evil in its own bowels. A Mind that is over-run with Vice will as neceſſarily be corrupted, and weakened, and vitiated, as the Body is decayed and impaired by a Diſeaſe. The one will as neceſſarily put the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:103342:79"/>Mind out of order, as Sickneſs does the other; and till it be cured and made ſound, it will alwayes be in pain and uneaſie. Its Faculties will neceſſarily be weakened and impaired, and diſordered by it, and ſo loſe their true and proper happineſs; and it will be put into an unnatural frame and temper, and be like the Body when its Limbs are out of joynt, in great torture till it be ſet right again. God muſt alter his own Nature, and the Nature of things too, or elſe Vice and Wickedneſs, whilſt 'tis continued in, will make the Mind miſerable, ſickly and uneaſie, and fill it with reſtleſneſs and diſquietude, and make it a torment and vexation to it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Without Repentance, and being freed from our Sins, we can never be capable of partaking or enjoying any true and poſitive Happineſs, much leſs that great and eternal one in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve. Happineſs muſt be ſomething within our ſelves, like Health, it conſiſts in the right craſis and conſtitution of the Mind, in the ſtrength, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, and regular operation of all its Faculties. Till it be put into this ſtate by Repentance and Vertue, 'tis unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:103342:79"/>of enjoying any true Happineſs. Our Vices muſt therefore be firſt cured and purged out, or elſe our Souls will be as uncapable of enjoying their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſpiritual and rational pleaſures, with their Sins, and wicked Habits and Diſpoſitions upon them, as our Bodies of enjoying their animal and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual ones witha Lethargy or Apoplexy, or whatever deſtroys their proper ſtrength, ſenſe and perception. Without Holy Minds, and Vertuous Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Heavenly Affections and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, as we can no way hope for Heaven, ſo we are no way fitted or qualified for it, and therefore our Minds muſt neceſſarily be diſpoſed and prepared for that by Repentance and previous habits of Vertue, and ſuch a divine temper and holineſs of Mind, as can alone make us <hi>meet to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the inheritance of the Saints in light,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.12. without which we ſhould no more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy Heaven than a blind Man enjoyes the light of the Sun, whoſe Organs are ſpoil'd and vitiated, and who wants the uſe of thoſe Senſes and Faculties by which he ſhould perceive it. So that if a Sinner ſhould be ſent to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:103342:80"/>with all his unrepented Sins, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified Luſts and vitious Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and without that love of God and Goodneſs which is to fit him for it, he would be not only like him which came to the Marriage-feaſt without a Wedding-garment, who muſt be turned out of that company he was ſo unfit for, but like one that had the greateſt dainties ſet before him, but that was ſick, and had no ſtomach, and ſo could not taſte or reliſh any of them. Till the Mind is brought to love God, and delight in him, and in all the actions of Vertue and exerciſes of Religion, it canot be happy in Heaven, but that would rather be unagreeable and an averſion to it, than an Happineſs. Till a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner therefore be brought off from his Sins by Repentance, and reſtored to a vertuous, and holy, and good Mind, he cannot enjoy Heaven or Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor be freed from Sin and Miſery, nor can a Holy and Wiſe God be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to him, or forgive him.</p>
                  <p>Upon all theſe accounts we ſee his Repentance is abſolutely neceſſary to entitle him to Pardon and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and without this he muſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:103342:80"/>and unavoidably periſh. Now,</p>
                  <p n="8">8. This abſolute neceſſity of it is a ſtrong and powerful Argument to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us to it. Whilſt Men have any hopes of eſcaping with their Sins, this with the pleaſures and temptations of them will encourage them to perſiſt in them, and to enjoy their Luſts and their Liberties which they have made very hard and uneaſie to deny themſelves, but when they find they muſt either do this, or elſe neceſſarily periſh for ever; this, if any thing, will prevail upon Men who believe and conſider the dreadful horrour of Everlaſting Damnation. Now the abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Repentance is as plain by the Goſpel, as the power and validity of it. We are as much aſſured that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it we ſhall be damned, as we ſhall be ſaved with it. Now this above all commends a Medicine to us, that it will cure us if we uſe it, but that we ſhall dye if we do not; however bitter and unpalatable it may be, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may diſorder us while it is working upon us, and however pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful the operation may be, yet if we muſt loſe our Lives without it, this will make us chooſe and endure it,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:103342:81"/>and go through with it. Though we muſt cut off a Right-hand, yet if the Gangrene will kill us if we do not, we ſhall ſubmit to it. Though it be very painful to part with our Luſts and our beloved Sins, yet ſince we muſt be damned if we do not, this will bring us to it. If a Man muſt ſink unleſs he throwes away his rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt lading, and diſcharges himſelf of his weighty treaſure, he will loſe that rather than his Life; and if he be not mad, he will for the ſame reaſon, caſt away his Sins rather than his Soul. No Man diſputes this when he is brought into ſuch a neceſſity, ſuch a ſtrait and exigency as to be thus tryed. Now Chriſt has by the Goſpel put this neceſſity upon us, either Repent and leave your Sins, or periſh with them. There is no avoiding this, no poſſibility to prevent it any way, and therefore when there is but one thing to be done, and ſuch a neceſſity for doing it, one would think it ſhould do it ſelf; but this is a neceſſity of Reaſon, of Choice, of Thought, of Deliberation, that requires our Minds to think of it and conſider it, or elſe it will not work upon us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:103342:81"/>we can throw off the force and power of it by not thinking, or not conſidering of it; but if we did as we ought, duly conſider of it, it would have an irreſiſtible force and power upon us, and no Man could hinder the effect of it; but he that will ſhut his eyes and not ſee a precipice may fall down it, and the greateſt neceſſity of avoiding any danger is took off by not heeding, or not being ſenſible of it, though it be never the leſs great in it ſelf for all that, and the neceſſity would work upon any but thoſe who are heedleſs and inconſiderate.</p>
                  <p>Sad is the ſtate and condition of thoſe under the Goſpel, who live in a ſtate of Sin and Impenitence, or in the habit of any unrepented Sin, they are under as abſolute a ſentence of condemnation, as if the great Judge had pronounced it upon them, and bid them, <hi>Go ye curſed.</hi> Whilſt they continue ſuch, there is no more hopes of Mercy for them than for the damned themſelves. Their ſtate indeed is not as unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as the others is, and this is the only difference, for they are otherwiſe as much Children of Wrath as they: They are not bound in chains of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:103342:82"/>nor confined to this ſtate by an irreverſible Judgment, but they are fettered to their Sins, and to their ſtate by their own choice, and till they break thoſe bonds, and get free from them, they can never come out of that ſad condition; which ſhould make every impenitent Sinner tremble, and ſeriouſly bethink himſelf what a ſad ſtate and condition he is in, what a doom hangs over his head, and how near his ſteps take hold of Death, how he walks upon the brink of Hell and Damnation, and the leaſt fatal accident, or ſudden death, does irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably throw him in without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, which ſhould make his Heart tremble, and his Blood chill, and his Hair ſtand an end, if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered it as he ought. Let him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſolve to ſnatch himſelf out of the fire, and ſpeedily recover himſelf from the jaws of Death; Repentance alone can do this, and this he ſhould ſet about immediately, and be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to it by thoſe powerful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and Arguments which the Goſpel and Chriſtianity propoſes, and which I have from thence offered to him.</p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:103342:82"/>
                  <p>I ſhall ſubjoyn to theſe another Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or Exhortation to Repentance, which I cannot call ſo properly Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical and peculiar to the Goſpel, but what ariſes from both Nature and Reaſon, and ſome Goſpel Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations mixt together, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated with thoſe, and that is the Conſideration of Death, and our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made ready and prepared for it by Repentance, and therefore that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe can free us from the fears and terrors of it.</p>

                  <p>THE laſt Motive then I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to Repentance is this, that nothing elſe can prepare and make us ready and fit to dye, and therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe can take off the fear and terror of Death, to which in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we muſt otherwiſe be expoſed, and ſo <hi>all our life time ſubject to bondage,</hi> as the Scripture ſpeaks. Dye we know we muſt in a little while, and there
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:103342:83"/>is none ſo fooliſhly Sceptical as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or disbelieve this, and to hope to eſcape the Grave where he has ſeen all his Fore-fathers laid before him, and which is the common lot or fate of every Mortal. There is nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more concerns us while we live, than to be alwayes ready and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to dye, this ſhould be our great work and buſineſs, if we conſidered the true end of living, or underſtood the mighty conſequence of dying, as Religion repreſents them both to us; and he that is not ſo fooliſh as to think he ſhall never dye, ſhould above all things take care ſo to live that he may be alwayes ready to dye; and of the two, 'tis a greater folly to think we ſhall dye, and not prepare for it, than to think we ſhall not dye at all. This it is then which a wiſe Man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to do all his Life, to be ready and prepared for Death, which he knows will certainly come, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is uncertain when it will come, therefore to be alwayes ready, and alwayes provided for it. There is ſo much danger and hazard not to do this, and the folly of it is ſo viſible, and ſo amazing, that no Man of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:103342:83"/>Prudence, no Man in his wits, one would think, ſhould neglect to do it: 'Tis ſo important, ſo weighty, ſo abſolutely neceſſary a Duty, that our Saviour moſt earneſtly preſſes it in ſeveral Diſcourſes, and propoſes it in two or three Parables, that it may make a more ſtrong and lively impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon our Minds. In the Parable of the wiſe and fooliſh Virgins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. at the beginning, where the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Son of Man is compared to the unexpected coming of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom at midnight, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. in others to a Maſters ſurprizing his Servants unaware at the ſecond or third watch, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.38. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. at the latter end, and in both the Evangeliſts, to a Thief ſtealing upon a Man at an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known and uncertain hour of the night: The deſign of all which is to preſs this great Duty upon us of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alwayes watchful, and alwayes doing our Duty, and alwayes prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for our Lords coming: This is the Inference which Chriſt draws from all thoſe Parables and Diſcourſes; <hi>Be ye therefore ready, for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not, Luke</hi> 12.40. Chriſt often calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:103342:84"/>the Son of Man, and as ſuch he is to be our Judge, and as a Judge he is ſaid to come when ever he paſſes Judgment upon us, and therefore St. <hi>James</hi> repreſents the nearneſs of his Judgment by that phraſe, <hi>Behold the judge ſtandeth before the door, Jam.</hi> 5.9. and his executing Judgment and Deſtruction upon <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was called <hi>his coming, Matth.</hi> 24.3. And as his final publick Judgment of all the World at the laſt day is called <hi>his coming,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.23. and ſeveral times in that Chapter of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> ſo his private Judging of us at our Death is his coming alſo meant by theſe ſeveral Parables, and for that coming of his we ought to be always ready; <hi>i. e.</hi> always prepared for dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

                        <item>I. That this Readineſs or Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſiſts only in Repentance, and a holy Life as the fruit and perfection of it.</item>

                  <p n="1">I. This Readineſs or Preparation for Death, conſiſts only in Repentance and a good Life as the fruit of it: For nothing elſe can fit us to dye, but to Repent and live well, neither can there be any other readineſs and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for Death but only that. For we muſt not imagine that we can be ready on a ſudden; and that though we were utterly unprepared before, that at a few days or hours warning we can make our ſelves ready and fit to dye: No, our whole Life, at leaſt a conſiderable part of it, is to be ſpent in making our ſelves ready; for we muſt not think that our Souls can, like our Bodies, be dreſt in a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or that we can be fit to meet the Bridegroom when he calls us in haſt, and on a ſudden. Vertuous ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits are not put on in a moment, nor can vitious ones be ſo eaſily and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſt off as our cloaths are; no, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like Diſeaſes that are chronical, and have by long time been growing upon us, they require long time, and great care, and much pains, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny remedies, and a timely courſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can be cured and got off, and before we can be well, and ſo ready
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:103342:85"/>to meet the Lord. 'Tis not a few pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitential tears upon a Death-bed will waſh away the filth of a wicked Life, or cleanſe a guilty and polluted Soul that has been many years contracting an habitual uncleanneſs, whoſe Sins ſtick to it like an old Leproſie, and have eat like ruſt or a canker into the very heart and ſubſtance of it, and yet they muſt be all got out by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and the Soul muſt be made ſound and clear, and recover it ſelf into a vertuous and good habit before it can be ready for another World, and duly prepared for a Future State. Indeed there is a great difference to be made according to the paſt courſe of Mens lives; there may be a great many ſuch happy Souls, who by a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry careful Education, and the good Example of their Parents and others, and by a Vertuous diſpoſition and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination in themſelves, and above all, by the Grace and Providence of God, have been alwayes kept from great and mortal Sins, and ſo never fell into a bad and damnable ſtate all their lives, but were alwayes vertuous and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent as to any ſuch offences as ſhould forfeit and endanger their Salvation
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:103342:85"/>by the terms of the Goſpel and the Covenant of Grace; without that we were all in a damnable ſtate, and the <hi>Scripture hath concluded all under ſin</hi> without that, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. For <hi>we have all ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God,</hi> and of that ſtrict and exact Obedience which we owe to the Law of God, ſo that if he ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Judgment with us, and be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and rigorous in demanding his utmoſt right over us, we could not <hi>contend with him, nor anſwer him one of a thouſand,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> ſayes, <hi>Job</hi> 9.3. and no Man can upon theſe terms <hi>be juſt</hi> with God, as he there ſayes: for ſo <hi>in his ſight ſhall no man living be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, Pſal.</hi> 143.2. but by the Grace and Mercy of the Goſpel, according to which God will now deal with Mankind, many, I doubt not, have been ſo juſtified, that through their whole lives they never were in a ſtate of Damnation, for nothing puts us into that under Chriſtianity, but a great, and known, and wilful Sin, or rather a courſe and habit of ſuch Sins: and though no Man liveth without Sin, that is, without ſome Frailties and Imperfections, and leſſer Sins,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:103342:86"/>which come not up to the perfection of the Divine Law, for which he ought to beg pardon, and ſay, <hi>God forgive us our treſpaſſes,</hi> yet God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that thoſe ſhould put us into an ill ſtate, for then no Man in the World would be ever out of it: But oh thrice happy are thoſe Souls who have not defiled themſelves with any great and damnable Sins, who have alwayes kept to their firſt Love, and preſerved their firſt Vertue unſtained and unſpotted, and have been ſo trained up in the wayes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Goodneſs, that they never wandered or went aſtray from them, nor never ſtept into the paths of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sin, ſo that their ſteps ſhould at any time take hold of Death; who never paſt out of that line which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides the two ſtates of Grace and Damnation, nor ever approached ſo near to the brink of Hell as to be in danger of falling into it. Theſe have reaſon to give thanks to God all their lives, who has thus kept them out of the ſnare of the Devil, and ſecured them from the jawes of Death and Deſtruction; and whilſt they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere and go on in this good ſtate
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:103342:86"/>and condition, and <hi>paſs from ſtrength to ſtrength, and from one degree of grace to another, and grow up in all manner of Grace</hi> and Goodneſs, tho' <hi>they have not already attained, neither are already perfect,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of himſelf, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12. yet they are alwayes ſafe, and alwayes ready for the coming of the Son of Man, and their whole Life is a moſt ſure, a moſt comfortable preparation for Death.</p>
                  <p>But theſe are very few I doubt, not only to the general number of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, but even to good Men; for moſt of the good Men we read of in Scripture were, ſome time or other, guilty of great and wilful Faults, as <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> and whilſt they were ſo, and before they had recovered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by Repentance, I cannot but think them in a bad ſtate; for Mens ſtates are not fixt and certain in this Life, but are alterable and changed according to their outward actions, and the inward temper of their Minds, and when ever a wilful and a known Sin breaks the courſe of Vertue, and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:103342:87"/>deſtroys the habit of Goodneſs in their Souls, it breaks their good ſtate, and deſtroys their comfortable condition; As when a Diſeaſe ſtrikes the Vitals of our Body, and overcomes the Strength and Health of our Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, unleſs we get it off it will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly bring Death along with it. God indeed has preſcribed us a certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and an infallible Cure for all Mortal Sins, and the greateſt Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Maladies and Diſeaſes that would otherwiſe deſtroy us, and bring Death upon us, and that is Repentance, which for the ſake of Chriſt and his Merits, and by the Mercy and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God ſhall recover us out of that miſerable and mortal ſtate into which every wilful Sin had caſt us. This ſhall ſet us right again in the Court of Heaven, where we were caſt and condemned before, and this ſhall bring us to a ſtate of Life and Grace, who were before ſtruck with the ſentence of Death. And bleſſed be God who has thus graciouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for poor, and otherwiſe loſt Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by Jeſus Chriſt! But Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, alas, though it be a ſure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, yet is not ſo eaſie a one as we
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:103342:87"/>imagine; 'tis a very bitter doſe that muſt not only go down very unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly, but muſt work ſtrongly and powerfully upon our Minds, it muſt not only make us ſick, and ſorrowful, contrite and troubled at the very Heart for every Tranſgreſſion, but it muſt purge out of our Souls every Sin, and carry off every vile Luſt and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Inclination. It muſt not only work upon the peccant humours, and ſo put the Soul into great trouble and diſorder, but it muſt perfectly heal and cure it, and to do that it muſt take away the root of the diſeaſe, it muſt ſearch to the bottom of the Heart, it muſt touch us to the quick in the tendereſt part of us, in the moſt darling Sin, and moſt beloved Luſt, and it muſt cut and launce ſo deep that no ſecret corruption remain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and no <hi>fomes Morbi</hi> be left behind. In a word, it muſt perfectly cure the Soul, and whatever diſeaſe it labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under, it muſt quite remove it, ſo that it never return again upon it; for 'tis but a palliating, a counterfeit or an imperfect cure till this be done: And till the Mind be perfectly reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and amended, and made better,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:103342:88"/>it has not truly repented; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scripture requires in Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, not only a <hi>broken Heart,</hi> which is the moſt ſignificant phraſe in the World for the deepeſt trouble of Mind for our paſt Sins, but it requires a <hi>new Heart,</hi> and a <hi>new Soul,</hi> and a <hi>new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and a <hi>new Man,</hi> to make up true Repentance; and not only that we be renewed in the Spirit of our Minds, but that we bring forth fruits worthy of Repentance, and that we turn from every evil way, and leave and forſake every Sin that we have ever been guilty of, as I have more largely ſhown before. We muſt do all this before we can be ſaid truly to Repent, and before we can have any good grounds to expect Pardon of any wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sin we ever committed in our whole lives, we muſt thus Repent of it: And though we are as ſure of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs if we do ſo, as if we had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver committed it, which is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt favour in the World, yet how will a poor penitent be alwayes afraid that he has not been ſufficiently ſorrowful, and fully repented of his Sins; how will his former Guilt affright him, when it ſtares him in the face; and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:103342:88"/>how will the ſad load of all his Sins lye heavy upon his Conſcience when he is brought to a due ſenſe of them; and how muſt he be contented to loſe a great deal of that comfort in his Mind here, though he may be ſafe hereafter; and though his Repentance may put him into a good condition, yet it will make his Heart ſorrowful, and the remembrance of his Sins will make it often bleed afreſh within him. And when he looks back upon his paſt danger he muſt tremble at it, tho' he has reaſon to hope he has eſcaped it, and it muſt keep him alwayes humble, and not over-confident of himſelf; and though he has his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in his hand, yet he muſt ſtill look upon it with tears in his eyes. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can truly ſatisfie a Man that he has repented of his Sins, but that he has left them out of Religious Grounds and Principles, and has had ſo much tryal of himſelf, as to know he would not commit them, though he were in the ſame circumſtances and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that he was in before. And thus when a bad Man is become a good one, when he that was careleſs and irreligious is become pious and devout,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:103342:89"/>when he that was vitious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd is become ſober and vertuous, when he that was unjuſt becomes juſt and righteous, and beſides reſtitution for all paſt injuſtice, would not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit one act of it to gain all the World, when he that ſtole ſteals no more, and he that was given to drunkenneſs or uncleanneſs, or any other Sin, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leaves and forſakes it, and is brought by Religion to be quite another Man than he was before, then, and not till then, is his Repentance ſuch as may make him hope for Pardon when he lives, and prepare him to dye with comfort. For to proceed a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this great concern, to make a Soul fit and ready for its immediate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering upon another ſtate, it muſt have theſe two qualifications at that time.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It muſt be thoroughly purged from every Vitious Habit, or elſe it is neither <hi>meet to be partaker of the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of the Saints in light,</hi> nor ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the Pure, and Spiritual, and Heavenly Happineſs. <hi>As the Tree falls, ſo it lyes,</hi> ſayes the Wiſe Man, <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> 11.3. And the ſame ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit and temper, as to the main, which the Soul carries out of this World,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:103342:89"/>will abide with it in the other. If any one habitual Wickedneſs remain upon it, or the love of any one Sin be ſo rooted in it, that if it lived here it would not be brought off from it, that will ruine it, and make it miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for ever; for if we love any one Sin more than Heaven, we muſt be contented to loſe and part with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for it; and if any Luſt or Vitious Inclination be ſo dear to us, that we are not willing to give it up for the ſake of Happineſs, we give up our Happineſs for the ſake of that, for they two are ſo inconſiſtent, that we cannot keep both. Let not therefore any Sin remain unmortified in thy Soul, if thou wouldſt put thy ſelf into ſuch a readineſs and diſpoſition, as ſhall fit thee to enter upon a happy Future State. And,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let all Vertuous Habits, and Religious Diſpoſitions of Mind be then excited, and exerciſed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to the higheſt perfection. 'Tis theſe will fit our Souls for Heaven, and be the true Wedding garment for the Marriage-feaſt, and 'tis theſe are meant by that expreſſion in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, of having our Lamps burning, in
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:103342:90"/>order to our waiting for the coming of the Bridegroom. Let our Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefore be then kindled into the higheſt flame and ardour, and our Souls expire and aſcend up in it to the Regions above. Let us raiſe our Minds to the higheſt love of God, and of our Bleſſed Saviour, and let our Souls be raviſhed with the thoughts of their wonderful love and kindneſs to us. Let us look up to Heaven, and to thoſe joyes which God has there prepared for us, and let us deſire, as ſoon as God pleaſes, to be tranſlated to them. Let us look down upon this World with mean and deſpicable thoughts, and let us conſider what a poor, and a miſerable place it is, and be very willing to part with it; and let us exerciſe all Faith, and Hope, and Truſt, and Confidence, in our Faithful Creator and Merciful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer and be willing to throw our ſelves wholly and chearfully upon them, and to truſt them with out Souls when they are going into an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known place, and to the inviſible <hi>Hades.</hi> When we believe our Lord is near, and coming in a few minutes, thus ſhould we wait for him, with our
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:103342:90"/>
                     <hi>Loyns girded up, and our Lamps burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as our Saviours expreſſion is, and our Minds put into ſuch a Religious frame and diſpoſition that we may be as like Heaven as we can, and our Souls may be ready to go in with the Bridegroom, and to be admitted to the Marriage-feaſt of the Lamb for evermore. We muſt not think that theſe Habits and Religious Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Mind are to be got on a ſudden, but we muſt bring our Minds to them by previous Acts, and long Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and frequent Exerciſes before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, and habituate our ſelves to theſe Divine and Religious Duties and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, or elſe we ſhall find, like the fooliſh Virgins, that we want Oyl, and have nothing in our Souls that ſhould feed, and nouriſh, and kindle, and maintain theſe Heavenly Habits and Diſpoſitions, which are the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate readineſs of our Minds. But to give the plaineſt advice I can, in ſo important a matter, I ſhall propoſe two eaſie Directions, which I would have every one obſerve that would make himſelf the moſt ready for Death, and the coming of the Son of Man.</p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:103342:91"/>
                  <p>The 1ſt is, To be doing all the good we can to promote the Honour of God, and the Welfare of Men; to be as the Parable repreſents it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. at the latter end, doing earneſtly the buſineſs of our Lord, and taking all the care we can of his Family, and <hi>giving them their meat in due ſeaſon,</hi> and diſcharging all that truſt faithfully and diligently which our Lord hath committed to us, and <hi>not ſmiting our fellow ſervants,</hi> or doing any the leaſt injury to others, or <hi>eating and drinking with the drunken,</hi> and living careleſly and idly, as the evil Servant is ſaid to do, <hi>Who put away the thoughts of his Lords coming, ver.</hi> 48. Thoſe who do that are apt to be negligent and wicked, but he that is alwayes watchful, and alwayes wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Lords coming, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable deſcribes the good Servant, will be faithful and diligent in performing every Duty, and every Office that his Lord requires of him, and will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving and deſigning to do all the good he can to pleaſe his Lord, and purchaſe his Favour; for he knows that an idle Servant ſhall be puniſhed as well as a wicked one, and that the omiſſion of a neceſſary Duty, commanded us by
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:103342:91"/>our Lord, will be as much charged upon us as the commiſſion of any thing that he has forbidden us: He will therefore be careful and diligent to do all his Maſters Commands, to fulfil all his Will, to help and relieve his fellow-ſervants, and do all the good he can in his Maſters Family, encourage others to do their Duty, exhort, adviſe, reprove and admoniſh them, and prepare them, as well as himſelf, for his Lords coming, and <hi>Bleſſed is that ſervant, who when his Lord cometh he ſhall find thus doing,</hi> and thus employed. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He that will be thus ready muſt never allow himſelf in any Sin, or in the doing of any thing that he knows is unlawful, and forbidden by his Lord; for if his Lord cometh and findeth him in that, <hi>He ſhall cut him aſunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites, there ſhall be weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gnaſhing of teeth, Mat.</hi> 24.51. There is no hopes for him if he be thus ſurprized in his Wickedneſs, and Death overtake him in the midſt of his Sin, like the revenger of Blood, before he can get into any City of Refuge. He that ventures upon a
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:103342:92"/>wilful Sin, ventures upon the very brinks of Hell and Damnation, and if a ſudden Death turn him over, he falls in irrecoverably; and at beſt he that ſuffers himſelf to live in a bad ſtate, <hi>i. e.</hi> in a courſe of Sin, hangs over the bottomleſs Pit by no other hold but the weak and brittle thread of Life, and if that break, or be cut aſunder, he drops into that dreadful place of horrors. No Man therefore who is maſter of his Wits, and knows he is not maſter of his Life, ſhould dare to live one moment in ſo much peril, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſuch danger and hazard, and venture his Soul and his laſt ſtake up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo tickliſh a caſt as this uncertain Life is: But he ſhould inſtantly, whilſt he has this thought offer'd to his Mind, catch himſelf out of the Fire, out of the Eternal Flames of Hell, into which, ſo far as he knows, he may be juſt a falling; for they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round him, and are ready to lay hold upon him as long as he continues in his Sins, and the gulph is open and ready to ſuck him in, and ſwallow him up, till he plunges out, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcues himſelf by a ſpeedy Repentance. Let no Man then make one hours, one
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:103342:92"/>minutes delay, who knows not how few hours or minutes he may have.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. For in the next place to give ſome Reaſons why we ſhould be thus ready: <hi>Who knows at what hour the Son of Man cometh?</hi> Who that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared knows what time he ſhall have to prepare himſelf? Who can tell whether the next moment ſhall be his own, and how little time he may have for ſo great a work? And who would loyter any part of his time, who knows how much that work will take up; for 'tis not a few ſpare hours, or dying minutes, will put the Soul into a readineſs, will change its tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and purge out its Sins, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and fit it for another World? And who can ſet back Death but a few hours when it gives a ſhort warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and is ready to ſtrike us; or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps without any warning ſeizes and hurries us to the other World. It is every day making up to us, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches nearer us every hour, and with quick and undiſcerned ſteps it dogs and follows us, and may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take us before we are aware of it. A ſudden Feaver may ſet the ſtrongeſt
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:103342:93"/>Body on fire, and preſently flare out the Lamp of Life. A Convulſion may ſeize in a moment the main fort of Life, and ſurprize us in our greateſt ſtrength. An Apoplexy or a <hi>Deliquium</hi> may ſtop the nimble wheels of Life that moved vigorouſly and ſtrongly juſt before, and make all the Vital Faculties ſtand ſtill immediately. Beſides a thouſand accidents from without, make us in the midſt of Life to be in Death, ſo that we can never be ſecure, but we may be a dying, and every time we expire, it may be, ſo far as we know, our laſt breath. Who would not be then ready who may thus be called on a ſudden, who may have <hi>the Son of Man come in an hour when he thinketh not.</hi> Come he certainly will, but we cannot tell whether in <hi>the third or fourth watch of the night;</hi> let us then <hi>watch the whole night,</hi> that is, be ready alwayes. If we knew the time of his coming we might be careleſs, and ſleep, and drowze perhaps till he was near us, but ſince we are alwayes to expect him at an uncertain hour, let us put our ſelves into a poſture and readineſs to receive him at his own time. We can never be ready too
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:103342:93"/>ſoon though he come late, but if we are too late before we are ready, we loſe an opportunity we can never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and we ſlip that time which we ſhall bewail to all Eternity. Let us think,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Upon the certainty of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If there were any hopes that he would never come, if there were any probability that we ſhould never dye, if any Man could be ſo fooliſh as to perſwade himſelf to doubt of that, he might have ſome reaſon to neglect the other, but no Man can be Sceptical as to that point, nor be ſo vain as to diſpute himſelf out of the belief of it, but he knows and is convinced of that fatal Truth, that he muſt once dye, and be laid in the ſame place of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs where he has ſeen ſo many others laid before him; why ſhould he not then prepare and provide for that which will dertainly happen? it can never be in vain or to no purpoſe to do this; it can be no loſt labour, no unneceſſary work, but all muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it ought to be done one time or other. Why do we not then do that which we own to be neceſſary? Why that it is indeed, ſayes the fooliſh
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:103342:94"/>Sinner, but it may be done hereafter, and at a more convenient ſeaſon! Would you not think a Man mad that ſhould talk thus when he was in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of drowning, and would not take hold of the rope was thrown out to him till his laſt and third riſing, but let go what he had in his hand in hope to catch it again afterwards? or he that was like to fall down a precipice, and would not ſave himſelf when he might, but truſt to a twig that was near the bottom? He deſerves to periſh that will not be willing to be ſaved till he is juſt periſhing. And he that allowes himſelf to live in a ſinful ſtate at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, with hopes to get out of it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, is but like him that ſtabs himſelf with a deſign of being cured, or ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows down a deadly Poyſon upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of taking an Antidote after he has done it; the one is certainly ſtrong enough to kill him, and the other may not be ſtrong enough to ſave him, or he may be dead before he can take it. Mens reſolutions to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent hereafter are alwayes inſincere, for if they were not they would Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent at preſent: And beſides what a ſad ſtate are they in till they do this;
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:103342:94"/>they are like Priſoners lying under a ſentence of Death and Condemnation, who hope to procure a Pardon, but will not endeavour to do it till they are called to Execution, and it be too late. Their unrepented Sins do put them into as damnable a ſtate as if Heaven had paſt ſentence upon them, and though they know this yet they are willing to continue ſo till their ſtate is deſperate, and they are never like to be otherwiſe. For he has no reaſon to think he ſhall be ever ready, who is not willing to make himſelf ready at preſent. Let us not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore delay one minute this great work of Repentance, but let us ſet about it immediately, and reſolve to go through with it, and to live in ſuch a conſtant habit and practice of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and a good Life, as ſhall make us duly ready and prepared to dye. For,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let's conſider how terrible Death muſt be to a wicked impenitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and what concern he will be in at the approach of it, when he muſt leave all the pleaſures of his Sins, and the remembrance of them fills him only with terrour and aſtoniſhment,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:103342:95"/>when all their falſe charms and mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricious looks, whereby they before pleaſed and enchanted him, go off, and they now look gaſtly and frightful, and ſtare him in the face with a ſcaring ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and with the ſad apprehenſions of what they are like to end in; when a dreadful Eternity preſents it ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and is like to ſwallow him up in an horrid abyſs of Miſery, when he comes ſo nigh to the other World that he can look as it were over to it, and ſee the ſad reception he is like to have there, when he ſees Hell open before him, the bottomleſs Pit gaping to receive him, and ſome of the Flames of it flaſhing as it were out upon him; when Death like an Executioner comes to ſeize and apprehend him, and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him before the dreadful Tribunal, where all his paſt Actions muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, all his ſecret Sins laid open, and a dreadful Sentence ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately pronounced upon him. The thoughts of this is enough to make a good Man afraid, and the beſt of us muſt tremble when we come before this Judgment-ſeat, and are to have our everlaſting Fates decreed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, but the Wicked muſt be
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:103342:95"/>filled with terrour and amazement, who can have no hopes, no refuge to fly to, who has no plea for any Mercy or Pardon, nor no excuſe to make for himſelf, who has neglected and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed all the means of Grace that were offered to him, and who would not be perſwaded to any true Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance before it was too late, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt now Repent in vain for ever. Who can expreſs the bitter thoughts, the fears, the horrours, the agonies of ſuch a Soul at that time? and who would ever feel them, who has now power and opportunity to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void them? Death carries ſomething of terrour in it to all Men, as it is a puniſhment of Sin, and a dark paſſage to the unknown Regions that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and it may be either great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption or great ſtupidity to have no Fear of it. A good Man may not overcome all the Natural Fear of Death, but the wicked has all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be ſcared and terrified with it, when it comes near him, or he thinks of it.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall therefore in the laſt place conſider the Terrour of Death, and how we are only freed from this by
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:103342:96"/>Repentance and Religion, by the hopes and aſſurances of Chriſtianity, and our having ſincerely Repented of all our Sins, and ſo as I have ſhown, fitted and prepared our ſelves thereby for Death.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="7" type="section">
                  <head>
                     <hi>SECT. VII.</hi> Of the Fear of Death, and how we are delivered from it by Repentance and Religion.</head>
                  <p>THere is no Natural Evil ſo great as Death, the King of Terrors, and the chief of thoſe dreadful things that Humane Nature is afraid of. <hi>Skin for skin, and all that a man hath will he give for his life, Job</hi> 2.4. He is willing to part with every thing that he may compound with it; nay what will not he not give to purchaſe a ſhort reprieve from Death and the Grave? that he may but ſet them back a while, and gain a little more time to live. How is the poor Man willing to endure any thing, to linger out a miſerable Life a little longer, though in the midſt of pains, and aches, and greater torments of Body perhaps then he would feel
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:103342:96"/>in Death it ſelf. How patiently will he ſubmit to the moſt tedious penance, and ſevereſt diſcipline that his Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian ſhall lay upon him, and ſwallow down the moſt loathſome and bitter draughts, that the more bitter cup of Death may paſs from him. How will he endure the utmoſt cruelties of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, and bear a living Martyrdom rather than dye, have his Body burnt and ſcarified, his Fleſh cut and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled to the Bone, his Limbs cut off or ſawn aſunder, that ſo he may dye by piece-meals, and out-live ſome part of himſelf, and eſcape out of the hands of Death, though it be never ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly, and run away from it though he leave a Leg or an Arm behind him. This ſhows how Natural the love of Life is, and how willing moſt Men are to preſerve and purchaſe it at any rate, and with what abhorrence they look at Death, and how it frights and ſtartles them when it comes near them; when they behold its pale look, and its terrible viſage, and ſee the ghaſtly mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter laying hands on them, and ready to lay them proſtrate at its feet, how does it then appalle and terrifie them, and make their Blood chill, and their
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:103342:97"/>Spirits cold and clammy, and their Hearts dye within them, when they think how their once brisk and ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bodies, that have been long enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the ſweet Pleaſures of Life and Senſe, ſhall in a moments time be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of all thoſe, and become only a heavy clod, and a cold and ſenſeleſs lump of Fleſh, laid out upon its once warm Bed, and then lock'd up in its little Cabin, and ſo laid in the proper place of Rottenneſs and Putrefaction, where it is to molder into Duſt, and to be as clean forgotten in a little time as if it had never been. This is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mortifying, and a very melancholly Conſideration to moſt Men, and when they conſider that in a little time this muſt certainly be their own caſe, and their own fatal condition, this muſt keep them in perpetual fear and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; if there were no proviſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Natural Fear of Death, if Religion did not afford us ſome helps and aſſiſtances againſt it, and there were not ſomething to take off, and abate its Natural Terrour, and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and ſtrengthen, and encourage the Mind of a good Man againſt it. Death as it is the Puniſhment of Sin,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:103342:97"/>and was for that end ordained by God, and brought into the World, <hi>for by ſin entered death,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.12. carries ſome marks of his Anger, and ſo muſt neceſſarily have ſome degree of Fear accompany it; but Chriſt who was to deliver Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind from the greateſt Puniſhments which our firſt Parents drew upon themſelves and their Poſterity by their Tranſgreſſions, and was to free us from the ſaddeſt effects of theirs and our own Sins, he has, tho' not quite, taken away this Puniſhment, no more than he has the other temporal ones occaſioned by the Fall, for we muſt ſtill dye, and ſtill have ſome fear of Death, yet the worſt effects of Death, and for which it was moſt to be dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thoſe Chriſt has delivered us from; and it was one great reaſon why he became a Man, and why <hi>he took part of the ſame fleſh and blood of which we are partakers,</hi> and which makes us ſubject to Death, <hi>That through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is, the Devil, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them who through fear of death were all their life time ſubject to bondage,</hi> as the divine Author of the Epiſtle to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:103342:98"/>the <hi>Hebrews</hi> aſſures us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.15. Now the wayes by which Chriſt and Chriſtianity do this, are chiefly theſe two;

                  <p n="3">3. Give ſome Directions about thus overcoming the Fear of Death, that ſo we may not be too much terrified with it when it approaches.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Chriſt and Chriſtianity free us from the Fears of Death, by aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring us of another Life, and of a Glorious Immortality after Death. Death would be very terrible indeed, if it took away our Being, and made an end of us when it came and put us into a ſtate of Annihilation. If the Grave were to ſwallow us up, and we were to paſs into the dark abyſs of Non-Entity when we went out of the World. If when we expired our laſt
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:103342:98"/>Breath, our Souls were to paſs with it into the ſoft Air, and we were to be no more after we went off the ſtage of this World. Nothing can be ſo cloſe, ſo deſirable as our being, which is the foundation of all Happineſs and Enjoyment to us, which ſome have thought ſo conſiderable that they have ſuppoſed it more eligible to be miſerable than not to be at all, though I can by no means be of their mind, and think being only in order to be miſerable, to be no deſirable thing, if the Miſery be greater than the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of being, and bare exiſtence is a very thin evanid, abſtracted thing to be compared with ſolid and ſubſtantial Miſery, but the cloſeſt Principles of Self-love and Self-preſervation, muſt make us very unwilling to part with our Beings, and all the Pleaſures and Enjoyments that belong to them; and therefore if we were to reſign up thoſe by Death, it would be very terrible: And how could we be ſure we did not, if we had not firm and certain grounds of another Life after this, or if we had nothing but the uncertain gueſſes and conjectures of it from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Light. Moſt Men indeed had
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:103342:99"/>ſome dark intimations of this from thence, and did either hope or fear there might be ſuch a thing rather than believe it. But now Chriſt hath brought <hi>Life and immortality to light through the Goſpel,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. He hath utterly diſpelled that cloud which kept thoſe of this World from ſeeing into another, and hath clearly and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly revealed to us the certainty of another and an Immortal State, and by his Reſurrection from the Dead and Aſcenſion into Heaven, given vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and ocular demonſtration of it. And how ſhould this take off the Fear of Death, when we are ſure of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Life after it, when 'tis only a paſſage to another and a better World too, if it be not through our own fault, if we are not unprepared and unfitted for it? if we are, then indeed this is no great Comfort to us, but we might wiſh that Death would put an end to our Being; but if we have Repented us of all our Sins, and are truly prepared for Death, this ſhould much leſſen and abate the Fear of it; when though we may be a little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to leave our old State and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, our old Dwelling and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:103342:99"/>Habitation, our old Friends and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and to go into a new and unknown place, yet we are ſure in the general, that we ſhall be much better provided for, and in a much better condition than we are here; and tho' the paſſage ſeems to us rough and dangerous, and we are loth to leave the ſhore, and to launch into the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty deep of Eternity, yet this is a ſort of Childiſh fondneſs in us to what we have been uſed to, and like the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of him that would not leave his poor and pitiful Cottage that he has alwayes lived in, though he were to go and take poſſeſſion of a Kingdom in another Country. Do not Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind that have more Wiſdom and a larger Spirit, willingly leave their own Native Country, and Kinsfolks, and Relations, and tranſport themſelves to an unknown place, where there is any fair hopes and probability of mending their Fortunes, and living in a more happy and comfortable condition? and have we not as good evidence, and as much reaſon to believe that Heaven is as rich and happy a Country as the <hi>Indies,</hi> or any other place where we have never been, and had only rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:103342:100"/>of them from others? has not Chriſt given us as much aſſurance of this as we can deſire? and has not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deſcribed and drawn the Chart and Map of thoſe Heavenly Regions, and given us as true and full an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Pleaſures and Riches of them, as we can wiſh for or expect in this Mortal State? If we knew them ſo fully and particularly as we ſhall do hereafter, we ſhould not ſo much love Life as we now fear Death; but God has concealed the particular knowledge of them from us at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that we may be willing to live here, but the general knowledge of a Future and Glorious Immortality which we have by Jeſus Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are aſſured that Death does not conclude our Being, but only tranſlate us to a much better State, if we be fit for it by Repentance, <hi>this</hi> ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us from the Fear of Death.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Chriſt has taken away <hi>the ſting of death,</hi> as the Apoſtle intimates, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56. and ſo has delivered us from the ſervile Fear of it, <hi>for the ſting of death,</hi> as he there ſayes, <hi>is ſin.</hi> 'Tis that which makes the darts of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:103342:100"/>Death ſo ſharp and poyſonous, becauſe they are envenomed with our own Sin, and dipt in our own Guilt. Were that but once drawn out, we might play with the harmleſs Serpent, and it would not bite or wound us. Could we diſarm Death of thoſe Terrours with which our own Sins dreſs it up, it would not appear ſo ugly and ſo frightful to us. 'Tis they which put us in a ſtate of Bondage and Servility, and depreſs and ſink our Minds with a ſlaviſh Fear that we are going to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution when we are going to dye, and that we are committed to the Grave but as to a Priſon where Death like a terrible Lictor or Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner is to torment us, or we are to be delivered over to him that has the Power of Death, that is the Devil. Now this may juſtly terrifie us, when we think that whenever Death arreſts us, it hurries us only to a place of Torments, and ſeizes us as condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Priſoners to be carried where we muſt ſuffer. 'Tis not leaving the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this Life makes Men ſo unwill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to dye, as the fear of going to the Miſeries of another. 'Tis not a preſent Temporal Death they are ſo afraid of,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:103342:101"/>as that Future and Eternal one which comes after it And this indeed is juſtly to be feared, were Hell to ſwallow us up as well as the Grave, and were we to ſink into the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Gulph when our feet take hold of Death; but Chriſt has delivered us from all the danger of this, if we do not wifully throw our ſelves into it. He has taken away all that Guilt, and all that Puniſhment due to our Sins which we are afraid of, if we have but ſincerely and timely repented of them; and though Death ſummons us to Judgment, and we know our ſelves Criminals, yet by the performance of that we have our Pardon ſigned in the Blood of Chriſt, and Heaven will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allow of it to a Chriſtian if he have not forfeited it by a deſperate Impenitence. True, and ſincere, and perfect Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance will free us in great meaſure from the Fears and Horrors of Death when it comes near us. Our Sins indeed will then be moſt apt to ſcare us, when Death ſets them in order before us, but we have all the aſſurance of the Goſpel, all the aſſurance of Heaven, that if we have duly repented of them, they ſhall no way hurt or indanger us; I will not
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:103342:101"/>ſay that they ſhall no way make us afraid, for this perhaps would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a very modeſt, and humble, and penitent Sinner to be quite fearleſs, but he will have great hopes with his fears, and very chearful and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able grounds that ſhall greatly leſſen and abate them; <hi>The righteous hath hope in his death, Prov.</hi> 13.32. Hopes that his Sins are pardoned in and through Chriſt, and that whenever he goes hence, he goes to a Glorious and Bleſſed Immortality, and this will take away if not all Fear of Death, yet ſuch a troubleſome and torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one, as fills us with perplexity and confuſion whenever we think of it, and makes us all <hi>our life time ſubject to bondage,</hi> as Scripture ſpeaks. And this will help to reſolve that Queſtion I propoſed in the ſecond place, namely,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whether a true Penitent, or good Chriſtian, ought to have no Fear of Death? I Anſwer, He ought to have no ſuch Fear as <hi>makes him all his life time ſubject to bondage;</hi> ſuch a baſe, ſlaviſh, immoderate Fear, as makes him not enjoy himſelf, but ſinks down his Spirit, and depreſſes his
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:103342:102"/>Mind to that degree, that he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes uneaſie, and perplexed, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed at the thoughts of it. Such as has been ſtoried of ſome, that they would not have the word Death na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in their hearing, for the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and thinking of it, made ſuch an impreſſion upon them, and ſtruck them with ſuch a panick Fear, that like the Hand-writing upon the Wall to <hi>Belſhazzar, Dan.</hi> 5.6. in the midſt of their jollity, it would make <hi>their countenance change, and their thoughts trouble them, ſo that the joynts of their loins were looſed, and their knees ſmote one againſt another:</hi> But above all, ſuch a Fear of Death as makes a Man think it a greater Evil than Sin, and ſo to avoid that will deny his Saviour and renounce his Religion, or do any thing whatever is neceſſary to eſcape a preſent Fear of Death. This makes him a ſlave to every one that has power to kill him, and to ſave his Life he will deliver up his Conſcience, his Soul, his Saviour, his Religion, and all thoſe things which ought to be a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more dear to us, and which we ſhould be much more unwilling to part with than our lives. Theſe are
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:103342:102"/>unreaſonable and unlawful Fears of Death, but there is ſtill a Natural Fear of Death which may belong to a penitent good Chriſtian, and which it is not neceſſary he ſhould wholly overcome, as it is a Natural Evil, as it is a Puniſhment of Sin, as it is a going to our laſt great and terrible Tryal before the Bar of Heaven, a Tryal upon which our Souls and their Eternal Fate of Happineſs or Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion does depend. This may cauſe ſome Fear in a true Penitent, or a very good Chriſtian, and I do not know that God has any where forbid it, or that he has promiſed ſuch a full aſſurance to every true Penitent and good Man, as wholly to take away all kind of Fear of Death, or that this is any want of ſaving Faith in him. In ſome extraordinary caſes God may give it, as in caſes of Suffering and Perſecution, when an extraordinary aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit, and an extraordinary aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of their Salvation, took away all Fears of Death and made them go to the Flames and to the Gibbet rejoycing and triumphing, but that this is ordinary and conſtant, I ſee no Reaſon nor no Scripture to believe.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:103342:103"/>The Fear of Death is a Natural and Invincible Infirmity to many a true Penitent, and good, and humble, and timorous Chriſtian, who though his Conſcience accuſe him not of any great and ill things, yet may magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie every little fault and imperfection, and not forgive it himſelf, tho' God does, nor be at peace in his own Mind, though he be with God, 'Tis a great perfection to conquer the Fears of Death, if it be done upon good grounds, for ſome have no Fear of Death out of a ſenſleſs ſtupidneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have no ſenſe of what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows after Death: And we find the greateſt part of Men who have moſt reaſon to be afraid of it, to be the leaſt ſo, out of meer Natural courage and hardineſs, and for want of thinking, or believing, or conſidering the things of Religion and another World; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from falſe Principles and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, by thinking a Pardon or Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution ſets them right in the Court of Heaven, and that they may boldly appear there with ſome ſuch ſecurity, or thoſe that have low thoughts of Religion, and think a little Sorrow for their Sins, and a few Sighs, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:103342:103"/>ſome Prayers when they come to dye, will carry them to Heaven as well as if they had lived never ſo Holily, and Righteouſly, and Godly. Now if Mens Confidence and Fearleſneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes from ſuch Miſtakes as theſe, 'tis like the hope of the Hypocrite that ſhall periſh, <hi>Job</hi> 8.13. and ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous perſons only ruſh into Hell with their eyes ſhut, and ſee not their danger before they are in it. On the contrary, a modeſt and humble peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Chriſtian may be afraid where no Fear is, may judge too hardly of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and may be though quite out of danger, yet not out of all Fear; for after all God will not judge us by our own Fears, or Hopes, or Opinion of our ſelves, which may be all ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and miſtaken, but he will judge Righteous Judgment, and correct the Errors by which we may paſs Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſelves; and the Terms of the Goſpel and not our own Thoughts ſhall be the Rule by which we ſhall be judged at the laſt day. But to take off the Fear of Death as much as we can, and to free our ſelves from a ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh and immoderate degree of it, the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:103342:104"/>beſt Directions that can be are theſe two.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. What hath been already given, duly to prepare and fit our ſelves for it by a timely and thorough Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</item>
                     <item>2. To joyn the livelieſt Act of Faith with this our Habitual Repentance, and exert that at the time when Death is near us.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">(1.) To perfect our Repentance, and ſo to live in the habit of that and of all goodneſs, that we may be the beſt prepared to dye that we can be. Dye we know we muſt. Death if it be not now near us, and yet we do not know but it may be dogging us at the heels, yet will certainly in a little time come up to us, and fright and ſtartle us when it does, if we do not take great care to be ready and prepared for it. Since we muſt therefore neceſſarily encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this great Monſter, this terrible Enemy which there is no eſcaping but we muſt certainly grapple with him, let us all our lives prepare for the battle, let us arm our ſelves with the whole armour of God and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, with a careful, and pious, and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:103342:104"/>good life, with a timely and thorough Repentance of all our evil ways, with a ſincere, and upright, and good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and with avoiding every thing that we know is ſinful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, and which will make Death terrible to us whenever it comes. Let us not be ſuch deſperate Bravoes in Sin, as to venture upon that with a falſe Courage, which will make us the worſt of Cowards when we come to dye; but let us be ſo wiſely afraid of Death now, as to live with that care and exactneſs that we may not be afraid of it when we come to it. It were well if ſome Men were more afraid of Death than they are, and as I am ſure they have all reaſon to be, that ſo they might be brought off from their evil wayes, and not run head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long upon thoſe dangers which are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near them, though they are not ſenſible of them. The ſword hangs over their head though they do not ſee it, and nothing but the thin thread of Life keeps it from falling upon them; they walk blindfold upon the brinks of Hell and Damnation, and it would be well of Fear would open their Eyes, and make them recover
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:103342:105"/>themſelves before Death makes it too late. Nothing can truly and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arm us againſt the Fears of Death, but Repentance and a good Life: To thoſe who have lived in the practice of them Death is a very harmleſs thing, 'tis but lying down to ſleep, cloſing the eyes and going to reſt, the Bodies being ſenſleſs a while, till it awakes at the great day of Judgment, and paſſing a longer night in the Grave till it ariſes more freſh and lively in the morning of the Reſurrection; and as for the Soul, 'tis a ſhort and quick paſſage from Earth to Heaven, and therefore ſuch have no reaſon to be afraid of it, when it approaches them never ſo near. But then,</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) Let the true Penitent quicken his Faith at that time, and raiſe that to the higheſt and ſtrongeſt pitch, that ſo he may then look beyond the grave, and ſee, and believe, and deſire thoſe happy and glorious things which God has prepared for him in another World. If we believed thoſe as we ought we ſhould never be ſo afraid to dye, if we were ſo affected with thoſe pleaſures that are above, and that are at Gods Right-hand for evermore, we ſhould
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:103342:105"/>not be ſo loth to part with the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures ſhall I ſay, rather with the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and the Miſeries of this Life. Did we think as we ought of that perfect peace, and joy, and ſatisfaction which is not to be had here, but to be met with only in Heaven, we ſhould not be ſo fond to abide in this Valley of Tears, and not go up to thoſe Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions above, where is full Joy and Contentment. Let us fix our thoughts and ſet our hearts upon thoſe happy Regions of Bliſs and Glory, and we ſhall not fear to paſs through the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Death to come to them, tho' the way to that Heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi> is through a Wilderneſs, through the dark and unknown Region of Death, through which a thouſand wandering Souls are alwayes paſſing, yet we ſhall be conducted ſafely through it by Angels, who will bring us to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of the great King, where we ſhall be received by our bleſſed Maſter and Saviour, and by all the Saints and holy Souls that are gone before us, who as they rejoyce at a Sinners Repentance, will now welcome him to his Fathers houſe; and we ſhall then as much wonder at our ſelves for
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:103342:106"/>fearing to dye, as we are now willing to live. If the account which Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gives us of thoſe inviſible Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be true, and we do fully believe that Joy, that Glory, that Bleſſedneſs, that unſpeakable Happineſs which is there revealed to us, this our Faith, joyn'd with our Repentance, ſhould overcome the Fears of Death, and make us not only not afraid, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be diſſolved, and to be willing to lay down this load and luggage of Fleſh, becauſe we know <hi>that if our earthly houſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:103342:106"/>will now offer Eternal Thankſgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and pay his Vows of Praiſe to his great Deliverer, and rejoyce ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more in his Glorious and Heavenly Salvation.</p>

               <p>I Am next to conſider, Whether all Sins are Pardonable, and may have this benefit of Repentance.

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:103342:107"/>theſe hard Opinions, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6. <hi>For it is impoſſible for thoſe who were once inlightened, and have taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, and have taſted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, if they ſhall fall away, to renew them again unto Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26. <hi>For if we ſin wilfully after that we have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the knowledge of the truth, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth no more ſacrifice for ſins.</hi> And 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20, 21, 22. <hi>For if after they have eſcaped the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, they are again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled therein and overcome; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end is worſe with them than the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:103342:107"/>different from all other Sins which are Mortal, and <hi>Sins alſo unto Death</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Repentance: And our Saviour ſayes expreſly of the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, that it is unpardonable, and <hi>ſhall not be forgiven, neither in this world nor the world to come, Luke</hi> 12.20. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.32. <hi>i. e.</hi> as St. <hi>Mark</hi> expreſſes it, <hi>It hath never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, but is in danger of eternal damnation, Mark</hi> 3.29. And what that is, is not fully agreed on by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, and ſo there may be fear, if not danger of a Chriſtians falling into it, and ſo into an unpardonable ſtate, by the Holy Ghoſts being ſo many wayes concerned in his Salvation, and he having ſo many wayes to Sin againſt him.</p>
               <p>This gives therefore great trouble to a great many Minds, and if one particular Sin, or any ſorts of Sin, be unpardonable by the Goſpel, they will be very fearful, and can hardly be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied but that they have committed that Sin, and ſo are cut off from all hopes by it; and they will like me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly perſons who read of ſuch grievous diſeaſes, fancy immediately that they have them themſelves, and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:103342:108"/>that ſuch and ſuch ſymptoms are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready upon them.</p>
               <p>If we cannot therefore aſſure all Perſons of Pardon for all manner of Sins, however great or however cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantiated upon their true Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of them, it will very much take off from the encouragements to this Duty, and by taking off Mens hopes in many caſes, and ſhutting the door of Mercy againſt them, hinder them from performing this Duty, and make them if not act deſperately and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as Men without hopes generally do, yet throw them into a comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and deſpairing condition, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm them with remedileſs ſorrow and trouble.</p>
               <p>The general ſcope and deſign of the Goſpel ſeems to be to remove all this, <hi>To preach good tidings unto the meek, to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound, to comfort them that mourn, Iſa.</hi> 61.1. To call thoſe to come to Chriſt <hi>who are weary and heavy laden,</hi> by reaſon of their Sins, with a promiſe, that <hi>he will give them reſt,</hi> Matth. 11.28. <hi>To preach Repentance and remiſſion of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:103342:108"/>ſins in his name among all nations, Luke</hi> 24.47. without excluding any Perſons, or excepting any Sins what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, to proclaim a general Amneſty and Act of Pardon, to all who Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and come in to the Goſpel. Had there been an exception, as to a more notorious Traytor, to any one, though a ſingle Sin which Mankind had been like to fall into, this would have aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both from the Goodneſs of God, and the Comfort of Men, when he ſhould be repreſented as implacable in ſome caſes and never to be appeaſed, and the other ſhould be left in ſuch danger and hazard, that if they fell into ſome Sins, which it was very poſſible for them to do, that then there ſhould be no hopes, nor no means of recovery for them.</p>
               <p>God, I doubt not, is more merciful, and Mankind not ſo miſerable, as to have any Sin whatever utterly unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable which is Repented of, but as our Saviour ſayes, <hi>All manner of Sin and Blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven unto men, Matth.</hi> 12.31. And as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> told the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, and it is not leſs ſo under the Goſpel, <hi>Though your ſins be as ſcarlet they ſhall be white as ſnow,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:103342:109"/>though they be red like crimſon, they ſhall be as wooll, Iſa.</hi> 1.18. that is, of however high a nature or degree they are, they ſhall upon Repentance and Amendment be done away and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given. No Sin is too great for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Mercy of God to forgive, and the infinite Merit of Chriſts Blood to atone, nor is any excepted in the Covenant of Grace which God has made with Mankind, wherein he promiſes univerſally <hi>to be merciful to their unrighteouſneſs, and their ſins and iniquities he will remember no more, Heb.</hi> 8.11. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.34. without any bar or reſerve to any Sin of what nature or aggravation ſoever. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Examine and Anſwer thoſe places of Scripture which ſeem to give any countenance to the other ſevere and cruel Doctrine, as to Sins of Apoſtacy, after Baptiſm, or upon Relapſe, and then largely conſider the Nature of the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and how or whether that is unpardonable, ſo as to free all honeſt Minds from any trouble about it.</p>

This can be no leſs than a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious apoſtacy and defection from Chriſtianity in general, and not only a wilful breach of any of its particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Laws.</p>
                  <p>And ſomething like unto theſe is that <hi>Sin unto death,</hi> in St. <hi>John.</hi> 1 <hi>Ep.</hi> 5.16. that which deſerved the utmoſt and ſevereſt cenſures; as he which under <hi>Moſes</hi> Law ſinned preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,

So under Chriſtianity this preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sinner was to be Spiritually cut off from all the Benefits of Chriſtian Communion, and from the Prayers of the Faithful, as we find they were by the Diſcipline of the Primitive Church.</p>
                  <p>This was ſo ſevere at firſt that they denyed all Peace and Abſolution to ſuch Apoſtates and <hi>Lapſi,</hi> even <hi>in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulo Mortis,</hi> at the point of Death, and would never receive them again into their Communion, thereby to fright all perſons from all falſe and cowardly compliances in thoſe times of danger and perſecution, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Church was forced to abate of this rigour, which had made ſuch Diſturbances, and occaſioned thoſe great Schiſms of the <hi>Novatians</hi> and <hi>Donatiſts.</hi> There were other Sins al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for which the guilty Penitents were excluded from all Communion to the laſt in thoſe purer and ſeverer Ages, as Murder, Adultery, and thoſe Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Luſts which they call'd <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra,</hi> theſe were never admitted to
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:103342:111"/>Pardon and Abſolution of the Church, as appears by the Canons of thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Councils of <hi>Eliberis, Arle;</hi> and <hi>Ancyra</hi> and by the Writings of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> and others, and the oppoſition made in <hi>Africa</hi> to the Decree of Pope <hi>Zephyrine,</hi> and by the milder Canons of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> afterwards, but all this was only prudential, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Diſcipline <hi>in foro humano,</hi> which the Church altered according to its Diſcretion, but they did not deny all Pardon with God for thoſe Sins upon Repentance, nor utterly cut them off from all hopes in another World, but allowed God could pardon them, tho' not the Church; that they might be forgiven, though not in this World, yet in the World to come, according to that <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Notion, that though there were no Sacrifices nor ordinary means of Expiation for ſome Sins, yet that God would forgive them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That Sins are Pardoned after Baptiſm as well as before, is plain from the Inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian,</hi> who though he had committed ſuch a Sin as was not uſual among the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:103342:112"/>and was to be put out of the Church, and to be delivered unto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan for it, yet this was not to cut him off from Pardon and Salvation, but as a better means to bring him to both; it was only <hi>for the deſtruction of the fleſh, that the Spirit might be ſaved in the day of the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. And this ſure was the deſign of thoſe ſevere and long Penances in the Primitive Church, whereby tho' they excluded Sinners from the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of Communion and means of Grace, yet it was not to bereave them of all hopes of Pardon, and conſign them irreverſibly to Damnation, but to beget a greater terrour and dread of Sin, and to make their Repentance for it more compleat and perfect, and ſo by thoſe preſent Judgments and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities here, to prevent their Eternal Condemnation hereafter, for this ought to be the Rule and Meaſure of all Church Power and Diſcipline, it ought to be for Edification not for Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and they could not miſs of this. The Spirit of God writes to the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> which were a company of Baptized Chriſtians, to <hi>Remember from whence they were fallen,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:103342:112"/>and Repent, and do their firſt works, Rev.</hi> 2.5. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> threatens the Chriſtians at <hi>Corinth, to bewail and correct</hi> thoſe which had ſinned, and <hi>not repented of the uncleanneſs, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and laſciviouſneſs they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.21. but does not denounce that they were unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Sad would it be if all wilful Sins were ſo after Baptiſm, this would make Chriſtianity a more terrible and ſevere diſpenſation than the Law, and put us in a worſe condition than we were without it, and no Man would then be Baptized till he was a Clinic and near dying, and going out of the World; but Baptiſm puts us into a ſtate of Pardon, and the Grace and the Vertue of it continues all our lives; and <hi>if we ſin we have an advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1. and his Mediation will upon our Repentance procure Pardon at Gods hands at all times for us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſhall next conſider Sins of Relapſe, when a Perſon after Sorrow and Repentance for a Sin, yet falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it again, and repeats it after he has reſolved againſt it, and been convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:103342:113"/>of the heinouſneſs of it; now this is a ſad caſe, and ſhows the power of his Luſts, and the weakneſs of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion upon a Mans Mind, and no Man who is in this ſtate can be ſaid to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: He is no more got rid of his Sins than a Man is of a Feaver be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it intermits ſometimes, and he is well by intervals, but his Fits return again upon him, which ſhows that the Diſeaſe is ſtill in his Blood, as the other's Relapſes do <hi>that ſin ſtill reigns in him,</hi> becauſe <hi>he obeys it in the Luſts thereof.</hi> A Man in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his Repentance from ſome ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Sins, may not get rid immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately of all his Evil Cuſtoms and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Inclinations, but they may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times draw him back again, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times maſter and overcome him, and he may rally again, and recover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and at laſt vanquiſh them: Now whilſt this Conflict laſts, and 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain which ſide will get the better, and have the final victory, no judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be made of a Mans ſtate, becauſe the iſſue is doubtful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain. He is fighting and ſtriving for his Life, for his Soul, and for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and he may by his own care and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:103342:113"/>endeavours, and by the aſſiſtance of Heaven conquer and overcome his Sins, and <hi>to him that overcometh God will give of the tree of life, Rev.</hi> 2.7. but if he is overcome by them, he is a ſlave of Sin, and a captive of the Devil, and a child of Hell, and heir of Damnation; but what ſhall a Man do who has often thus relapſed into Sin after his moſt ſerious Vows and Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions againſt it, are his Sins againſt thoſe unpardonable, and is there no hopes for him? I Anſwer by no means, if he can but recover himſelf from them, and after all attempts at laſt get rid of them, and bring forth the contrary fruits of Repentance and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. I confeſs ſuch an one ought to ſuſpect himſelf, and to ſuſpect his Repentance, till by many tryals he has made it good, and confirmed it; and he ought to be doubly watchful over himſelf, and to take heed leaſt Sin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter again at any of thoſe weak places at which it uſed to have admittance, and to fortifie himſelf againſt all thoſe temptations and opportunities that uſed to betray him to it, and therefore to keep his Mind to a cloſe ſenſe of Religion, and to a careful uſe of all
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:103342:114"/>the Means and Inſtruments of it, and to beg earneſtly of Heaven Grace proportionable to his needs, and then if it be not his own fault, it will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be ſufficient for him. But ſuch Relapſes, though they are not quite hopeleſs, nor put a Man into a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is deſperate, yet they are very dangerous, they grieve Gods Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, they give a new Wound to our Conſciences, they make the old Wound that was healed bleed afreſh, and render it more difficult to be cured again, and more ready to mortifie and become incurable, they bring the Mind to a weakneſs, and unſteadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and irreſolution, and to have no power or command over it ſelf, but let its good Purpoſes and Principles be bore down by a weak Luſt or a ſilly Temptation, and one ſuch fatal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe ſets it back a great way, and makes it with great difficulty roll up the ſame ſtone which hath driven it ſo much downwards, and with greater labour ſet upon the ſame work and deſign which ſuch a miſcarriage makes more hard to be effected.</p>
                  <p>They who make Repentance lye in ſome tranſient Acts, which upon new
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:103342:114"/>Sins are to be repeated <hi>toties quoties,</hi> like a Medicine to be taken as often as the ſame illneſs returns, forget that Repentance is a ſtate of Health after Sickneſs, a ſtate of Vertue and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience after Vice and Diſobedience, and that when ſuch a ſtate is once broken, 'tis not eaſie to be made whole again, but like a broken Limb, it cannot be ſet without great pain, and long time to grow together again, and that if it be often broken it will contract an habitual weakneſs and lameneſs.</p>
                  <p>How long God will ſuffer a Sinner thus to continue in a ſtate of Falling and Riſing, Repenting and Relapſing, before he cuts him off from any hopes of Pardon or benefit of Repentance, we do not know, nor how long a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened impenitent wretch may go on in a courſe of ſinning before the means of Grace, and the day of Salvation may be over with him; ſo that if he knock God will not open, and there ſhall be <hi>no place found for his Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi> This is a ſecret likewiſe which is only in the breaſt of the Almighty, who threatens that <hi>his Spirit ſhall not alwayes ſtrive with man, Gen.</hi> 6.3.
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:103342:115"/>And <hi>behold now is the accepted time, now is the day of ſalvation,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. And <hi>to day if ye will hear his voice har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den not your hearts, Heb.</hi> 3.15. And <hi>if thou in this thy day hadſt known the things belonging to thy peace, but now they are hid from thine eyes, Luke</hi> 19. 42. And <hi>ſeek the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near, Iſa.</hi> 55.6. So that God is not alwayes to be found, nor alwayes near, and it may be too late for the things of our peace, and the accepted time and the day of Salvation may not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue alwayes, but a Man may ſin ſo long till God will withdraw his Grace, and may come to an unpardonable pitch and an impenitent ſtate, and may <hi>deſpiſe the riches of Gods goodneſs, and forbearance, and long-ſuffering, not knowing that the goodneſs of God lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to repentance: But after his hardneſs and impenitent heart, may treaſure up wrath againſt the day of wrath, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the righteous judgment of God,</hi> Rom. 2.4, 5.</p>
                  <p>This ſhould keep us from neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the preſent opportunities, and not put off our Repentance from day to day; <hi>But to day, while it is called to
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:103342:115"/>day, hearken to his voice, leſt we be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened with the deceitfulneſs of ſin.</hi> But if any be under thoſe Fears that he has brought himſelf to that ſad ſtate, this is the only true ſatisfaction can be given him; Whilſt he is willing to Repent, and has a juſt ſenſe of his Sins, and of his ill ſtate, he is not har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, and if Gods Grace doth ſo far work upon his Mind as to make him ſee and apprehend the neceſſity of Repentance, and the forſaking all his evil wayes, then it is not quite with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from him; and if he be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to try all means, and uſe his beſt endeavours to get rid of his Sins, there is great hopes that he may effect this, for God will never be wanting to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt our ſincere Wills and hearty En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours; and if <hi>his Spirit worketh in us to will</hi> and to deſire to leave our Sins from a right apprehenſion of the danger and miſchief of them, and produce ſuch convictions and illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in our Mind, it is certain it hath not abandoned or deſerted us, and it will <hi>work in us to do</hi> alſo, and to effect and perform thoſe good thoughts and purpoſes if we perſiſt in them, and endeavour with our utmoſt power to
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:103342:116"/>make them good and effectual. No Man is cut off from Pardon who Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents and becomes a good Man, tho' he has been never ſo bad an one, and no Man will have Gods Grace denyed him, who is at any time ſincerely willing and deſirous to make uſe of it, but 'tis a hard and inſenſible ſtate that has ſinn'd away its Life, and its day of Grace, and has only deep hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and fruitleſs ſorrows when it is too late to amend and become a good Man, that is hopeleſs and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:103342:117"/>him, by ſhowing how unlikely it was that the Devil ſhould thus deſtroy his own Kingdom and Intereſt by being divided againſt himſelf, and lending him his Power to caſt out Devils, and that it might as well be pretended that all Miracles that were done by their Prophets of old, or by others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them afterwards, were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by a Diabolical Power as well as his, and ſo they would deſtroy the force and credit of their own Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles as well as thoſe he did, he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately proceeds to diſcourſe of this Sin, <hi>Wherefore I ſay unto you, all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſin and blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven unto men, but the blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall not be forgiven unto them.</hi> And he repeats it again in the next Verſe, <hi>And whoſoever ſpeaketh a word againſt the ſon of man it ſhall be forgiven him;</hi> that is, yet may with leſs guilt and danger abuſe me, for any thing elſe that does not ſo imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately reflect upon, and reproach the Spirit of God, as when ye called me <hi>wine-bibber, and glutton, and a friend of Publicans and Sinners,</hi> but <hi>whoſoever ſpeaketh againſt the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> if ye uſe any reproachful ſayings againſt the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:103342:117"/>Spirit of God by which I do my Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, this <hi>ſhall not be forgiven neither in this world nor in the world to come.</hi> Neither here, nor as ſome of you vainly expect hereafter, but ſhall be certainly and ſeverely puniſh'd in both. Now here is no mention at all, nor the leaſt intimation of thoſe other Sins in which ſome have placed this Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt; as in final Impenitence, which the <hi>Phariſees</hi> could not then be charged with, not Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy from Chriſtianity, which they had not at all profeſſed, nor were by this very likely to do; nor denying the Truth for fear of Suffering, as in the inſtance of <hi>Francis Spira,</hi> which is often ſaid to be his Sin, nor any of the ſix Sins in which the Schoolmen have placed it, as Envying our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Graces, Impugning the known Truth, Obſtinacy, Impenitency, Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration and Preſumption, which two latter are unluckily put together to make this one Sin, when they are ſo contrary to themſelves. Whatever mixture there might be of theſe, or any of theſe, or the like Sins, in the Minds of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> who commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:103342:118"/>yet thoſe are no more this particular Sin here meant by our Saviour, than Pride and Covetouſneſs, and other Sins that might go a great way, and be no ſmall cauſes to bring them to this Sin, and diſpoſe their Minds for it; but St. <hi>Mark</hi> ſets the thing beyond all diſpute in <hi>chap.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 28.29, 30. where he relates theſe words of our Saviour, thus, <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, all ſins ſhall be forgiven unto the ſons of men, and blaſphemies wherewith ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſhall blaſpheme: But he that ſhall blaſpheme againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall never have forgiveneſs, but is in danger of eternal damnation.</hi> And then he gives the reaſon of our Saviours ſaying all this to them, namely, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſaid he hath an unclean Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; i. e.</hi> a Diabolical and impure one, which makes it as manifeſt as can be deſired, that this their Sin was their blaſpheming and ſpeaking ſo reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully of the Holy Ghoſt which was in Chriſt, as if that were not the Holy Spirit of God, but an unclean and a Deviliſh Spirit. How great and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid a Sin this was, will appear from theſe four Conſiderations.</p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:103342:118"/>
                  <p n="1">1. It tended to deſtroy the whole Truth of Chriſtianity, and conſequently to rob the World of all the benefit it has by it. There could nothing ſo malicious be contrived to undermine the Foundation of the Goſpel, as this aſſertion of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour wrought his Miracles by the help of an evil or unclean Spirit; for this was to make him a Magician, a confederate with the Devil, and ſo to repreſent his Religion as a work and contrivance of Hell, that could tend only to the miſchief and deſtruction of the World: For if no good thing could come out of <hi>Galilee,</hi> as in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial deriſion they gave out to the People, to be ſure no good thing could come from Hell and from evil Spirits. The Devil would never lend his Power had he been able, to promote or eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh any thing but a falſe Religion, that ſhould withdraw the World from the Worſhip of the true God. The greateſt demonſtration for the Truth of Chriſtianity were the Miracles of Chriſt, as he often appeals to them, <hi>John</hi> 10.37, 38. <hi>John</hi> 14.11. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.4. and if theſe were done not by a Divine but a Diabolical Power, and
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:103342:119"/>by a compact with the Devil, they are then the greateſt Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; for then it may be only a myſtery of iniquity brought into the World by him <hi>whoſe coming is after the working of Satan with all power, and ſigns, and lying wonders, and with all deceivableneſs of unrighteouſneſs,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.9, 20. as Antichriſtianiſm is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It tends not only to undermine the Truth of Chriſtianity, but of all Revelation whatever from God. The greateſt proof and demonſtration that can be given to any Prophet that comes from God to reveal his Will to Men, is his working of Miracles, and ſatisfying thoſe he is ſent to that he has a Divine Authority and Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by his ſhowing his Credentials from God, who would never ſuffer a Cheat and Impoſtor to do ſuch migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty works as muſt neceſſarily cheat and deceive thoſe that ſee them. Now if notwithſtanding that he teach nothing contrary to the Nature of God, nor of Good and Evil, and yet perform ſuch wonderful Miracles as can be done only by the Finger of God, and by a Divine Power; if we will ſtill
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:103342:119"/>ſuſpect this, then we can never be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of the truth of any revelation from Heaven, and ſo the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did not only undermine Chriſtianity, but even their own Law; for it might with as much reaſon be ſaid, that <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets who pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to come from God, and wrought Miracles to ſhow they did ſo, yet were only the Prophets and Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of the Devil, and did all their Miracles by his Power, as of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This muſt proceed from a very ſpightful temper and malicious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that made them ſpeak this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Conſciences, and the ſenſe of their own Minds. Sure they who were eye-witneſſes of his Miracles, and ſo had the beſt and fulleſt evidence of the truth of them, and who heard the excellency of his Diſcourſes and Sermons, in which was nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Worſhip of the true God, or the Moral Duties of Religion, they muſt as our Saviour once told them, <hi>know both him and alſo whence he was, John</hi> 7.28. When they muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that he was both an innocent and good Man himſelf, and that his Doctrine commanded the higheſt Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:103342:120"/>and Goodneſs, and tended to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the whole Power and Intereſt of the Devil in the World, they could not ſurely believe themſelves, or think this their black charge was true; but when they ſaw the People amazed at his healing a Demoniack, and ſaying, <hi>Is not this the Son of David? Matth.</hi> 12.23. And ſo they feared that they ſhould have loſt their Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority together with their Law, and that the People ſhould have left them and followed him, then they gave out this vile and abominable reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, that he did all this by the Power of the Devil, which was the utmoſt ſhift that Malice could invent to blind the eyes of others againſt a Truth which they could hardly be ſuppoſed not to ſee themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It was the moſt taunting, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful Slander againſt God and his Holy Spirit that could poſſibly be, and therefore is alwayes called <hi>Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,</hi> which is the moſt daring, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking and tranſcendent Crime againſt God that can be, and proceeds from the moſt contemptuous and ſcornful, moſt wretched and depraved temper of Mind. To ſlander and calumniate
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:103342:120"/>the Son of Man was a great Sin, to call a ſober and temperate Perſon a Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and Wine-bibber, a friend of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and Sinners, and to raiſe ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous and falſe ſtories againſt any Mans Credit is one of the greateſt though the commoneſt Sins; but to proceed ſo far as to ſlander and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach God, this was accounted by one of the Heathens as bad or worſe than to deny him, but to repreſent the Holy and Bleſſed Spirit of God as an Apoſtate Angel, as a Helliſh Fiend, and to reproach, and ſcoff, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate whatever he does for the good and ſalvation of Mankind, as the work and intrigue of the Devil. This is ſuch an horrid Sin, that our Saviour ſays, <hi>it ſhould not be forgiven,</hi> but bring certain Judgment upon them.</p>
                  <p>I come now to inquire how and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what account it is Unpardonable, which is the greateſt difficulty about it. Now though no Sin in its own Nature be unpardonable, becauſe none ſo great but that the infinite Mercy and Goodneſs of God does ſtill exceed it, and none is exempted from that General and Gracious Promiſe of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don which he hath made to Mankind,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:103342:121"/>and none has ſo much Guilt in it, but that the Blood of Chriſt and Merit of his Sacrifice is able to atone and expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate for it, and none does ſo far cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and deprave the Mind but that the Grace of God can reſtore and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it; yet a Sin may however be unpardonable by reaſon of ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances attending it, and chiefly upon theſe three accounts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As not being Repented of, for ſo every wilful Sin is unpardonable: For though the Goſpel propoſes Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Pardon to every Sin and Sinner without exception, yet 'tis upon this never failing condition of Repentance and Amendment, without which we ſhall as certainly periſh, as if there had been no place for Mercy at all, but we had ſtood under an irreverſible decree of Condemnation for the firſt Sin we had committed. The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace is made upon that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition on our part, which if we fail of, we ſhall as certainly loſe the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of it as if there had been no ſuch Covenant made.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Sin is alſo unpardonable by the ſtanding terms of the Divine Mercy, which is not curable by all
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:103342:121"/>the ordinary means of the Divine Grace, but reſiſts and baffles all thoſe remedies which can be uſed to that purpoſe. As a Diſeaſe is uncurable when it is too ſtrong for all the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that can be uſed againſt it, ſo is a Sin unpardonable when it is too hard for all the means whatſoever that are proper to amend it. As when a Man will be an Infidel and diſobedient to God when he ſees plain Miracles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his face, and will not be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by all theſe, which are the beſt and only means to that purpoſe, when he will ſtill be obſtinate, and harden himſelf againſt the higheſt evidence that is poſſible, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did, when he could not but confeſs that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles were done by the Finger of God, and yet would not hearken unto him; or as the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who would not be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to Chriſtianity by all the viſible Wonders, and extraordinary Miracles wrought by Chriſt and his Apoſtles. What was there more to be done to ſatisfie thoſe Men? and how could any thing that God and the Divine Power was able to do convince them of their Infidelity, if this would not?
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:103342:122"/>And ſo now when all the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and all the credible evidences of Religion will not work upon a Man, nor perſwade him to a good Life; when he reſiſts all the means of Grace that God has appointed, he then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the laſt and utmoſt remedy that ſhould do him good, and ſo is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily in a hopeleſs uncurable ſtate and condition.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That Sin is unpardonable which provokes God to withdraw his Spirit, and all the influences of the Divine Grace, and to give them up to a ſpirit of ſlumber and a reprobate ſenſe, and hardneſs of Heart, as he is ſometimes ſaid to do, if not for one Sin, yet for a great many obſtinately and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimably continued in.</p>
                  <p>And now let us examine the Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Ghoſt by theſe 3 ways.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) Can it be ſaid to be unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able becauſe unrepented of? It ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not upon this account, becauſe it is probable that many of thoſe who were guilty of it did afterwards Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and turn Chriſtians. Among the many numerous Proſelytes to Chriſtianity in the time of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and eſpecially of the Apoſtles, it
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:103342:122"/>cannot be proved or thought that there were not ſome of thoſe made Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts that had fall'n into it; and Chriſt when he prayed for his Enemies, and for his Crucifiers, moſt earneſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated his Father <hi>to forgive them</hi> all without any exception, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.24. by which he had plainly ſome hopes of their Repentance and Amendment, and if he had not, it would have been in vain to have uſed ſo many means as he did afterwards to that purpoſe; beſides that he intimates not the leaſt word to them of their Impenitence, nor was that to be ſaid of them till the laſt, <hi>this</hi> would not ſufficiently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh this Sin from any other great and wilful one, for any ſuch unrepent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of and that by a particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, is unpardonable as well as this againſt the Holy Ghoſt, unleſs we will venture to ſay what we have no ſufficient warrant for, and therefore is very bold, and eſpecially when 'tis a kind of limiting the Grace and Mercy of God, that Men could never Repent of this as they can of all others, but that God who hath opened a door of Mercy and Repentance in all other caſes, hath abſolutely ſhut it in this,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:103342:123"/>ſo that they ſhall never be able nor willing to enter in.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) Is it unpardonable upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond account, as it was not curable by any means that God had appointed and thought fit to uſe to that purpoſe? This it ſeems not to be neither, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God had not yet made uſe of all the means that he intended for the Converſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees.</hi> Our Saviour indeed had done a great many Miracles to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie his Divine Power, but ſtill there were a great many more which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained behind, and which he had not yet performed. If we look into the Goſpel of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and obſerve the time when our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our had his diſcourſe of this Sin, we ſhall find he wrought many very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Miracles after that; and what was the deſign of all them, but to perſwade thoſe to believe in him, and to embrace Chriſtianity, who were not perſwaded ſo to do by his former ones. And there remained ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Motive behind, which was an evidence even beyond all, and which was ſuch an Argument to convince the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Infidelity, as did outdo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:103342:123"/>all the other Miracles of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and that was his Reſurrection from the Dead. This was the great and irreſiſtible proof for the Truth of Chriſt and his Religion, and of this eſpecially the Apoſtles were to be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to all the World, as being the ſtrongeſt demonſtration of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and it is beyond all controverſie, that a great many who were not brought to believe in Chriſt for his Miracles which they ſaw him do, or had as much reaſon to believe as if they ſaw him, yet were afterwards convinced and believed upon his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; and yet beſides this ſign, which our Saviour ſayes <hi>was to be given them</hi> after they had charged him to do his Miracles by an unclean Spirit, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.4. for that was meant by the ſign of the Prophet <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> there yet remained another means to cure the Infidelity of theſe People, and bring them off from their unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable unbelief, and that was the ſending the Holy Ghoſt in ſo viſible a manner upon the Apoſtles on the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> whereby the <hi>Jews</hi> ſaw and heard thoſe poor unlearned Men, who were Fiſhermen, and Publicans,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:103342:124"/>and Perſons of ordinary Rank, and little Education, ſpeak all ſorts of Tongues and Languages, more than the Learnedeſt of their own Rabbies were able to do, and work all ſorts of Miracles as great as ever <hi>Moſes</hi> or any of their Prophets were recorded to perform. This alſo without doubt made a great many Proſelytes to Chriſt and his Religion that were not ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and brought in vaſt numbers of Believers into the Church, as we read in the Acts of the Apoſtles. Now when ſo many means were appointed and uſed by God, and thoſe ſuch ſtrong and powerful ones, even after the <hi>Jews</hi> had been guilty of that vile reproach of many of our Saviours Miracles, who can ſay that this Sin was not curable by any remedies when they were not all uſed, but there were ſtill many others to be applyed? and who can ſay that the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> had reſiſted the laſt means of Conviction, when our Saviour and his Apoſtles had after that ſo many others to offer to them, and which might probably prevail upon them? it feem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth more likely from this which is ſo plain and undeniable, that the Sin
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:103342:124"/>againſt the Holy Ghoſt was the reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the means whatever that were or could be uſed by the Spirit of God, both in Chriſt and the Apoſtles too for the bringing Men to Chriſtianity, and ſo it became unpardonable becauſe it baffled the laſt means that could be uſed againſt it; and as to the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or reproach, which ought to be taken notice of as the very ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick form and eſſential difference of this Sin, none ſeem to be more lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally guilty of that, no not the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>Chriſt did his miracles and caſt out Devils by Beelze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub,</hi> or an evil Spirit, than they who in the time of the Apoſtles, when they ſaw them <hi>filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and ſpeaking with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance, Acts</hi> 2.4. yet mocking and vilely reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, ſaid, <hi>Theſe men are full of new wine, ver.</hi> 13. The aſcribing this viſible Power of the Holy Ghoſt on the Apoſtles to Drunkenneſs, and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> mocking at all this, as if they had been inſpired with the Spirit of Wine, or of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> rather than the Spirit of God, ſeems as great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and calumny to him, as the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:103342:125"/>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> againſt the Miracles of Chriſt and the aſcribing them to an unclean Spirit: And this was more eſpecially the time of the Spirits oeconomy and diſpenſation, when he was ſo plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully poured out upon the Apoſtles and other Chriſtians, and was ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World to be Chriſts Advocate, and the publick Patron of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whereas before when Chriſt was not glorified, it is expeſly ſaid that the Holy Ghoſt was not yet given; <hi>John</hi> 7.39. For all theſe Reaſons I ſhould be inclined to be of their Mind, who think this to be the true Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Ghoſt, which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unpardonable becauſe uncurable by all the means which the Spirit of God could uſe, were not the words of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and St. <hi>Mark</hi> eſpecially, ſo plain, that our Saviour ſpoke of this Sin <hi>becauſe</hi> the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees ſaid, He hath an unclean Spirit, Mark</hi> 3.30. and becauſe there is no other thing mentioned by our Saviour as the reaſon of his diſcourſe about it, but becauſe when he had healed the Blind, and the Dumb, and him that was poſſeſſed with a Devil, the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> ſaid, <hi>This fellow doth not caſt
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:103342:125"/>out Devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the Devils, Matth.</hi> 12.22, 24. Our Saviour did not only forewarn the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and tell them that this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny of theirs came very near, and was a preparation to the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and that this would be likely to bring them to commit that afterwards, if they took not great care of themſelves; but he ſeems plainly to charge them as already guilty, and not meerly in danger of it, and that which they had already ſaid was no doubt a moſt horrid Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and nothing could be worſe than to reproach the Spirit that was in Chriſt himſelf, to whom he was given not by meaſure, but in a more full and extraordinary manner than he was to others afterwards: For though the Holy Ghoſt was not before given to the Apoſtles nor other Chriſtians till Chriſt was aſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, yet he was given to him, and to reproach him in him was like the reproaching the Authority of a Prince, not only in his Envoys and Embaſſadors but in his own Son.</p>
                  <p>So that allowing the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt to be the aſcribing the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:103342:126"/>Miracles of Chriſt to the Power of the Devil, which ſeems to be the plaineſt and ſimpleſt account of it, and moſt agreeable to the words of our Saviour, and to the only places of Scripture where it is ever mentioned, and in ſuch a difficult matter we muſt be careful not to venture further than we have clear Authority from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf, <hi>then</hi> from what has been largely ſaid on this Head, it does not ſeem that this Sin was therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable, becauſe it had reſiſted and been too hard for all even the laſt means of Conviction which was to be uſed to recover Men from it, ſince there were many others that God had appointed after that.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) In the Third place, Can we ſay it is unpardonable upon another account, becauſe God was thereby provoked to withdraw his Grace and Spirit from thoſe who were guilty of it, and to give them up to hardneſs of Heart, and an uncurable ſtate of Mind? This we muſt not ſay of any but where God himſelf has expreſly declared it, and it would be great raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as well as uncharitableneſs to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce this of any, but where God
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:103342:126"/>has firſt pronounced it, which he has not, that I know of, of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> upon the account of this Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour indeed charges this in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon the whole <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, who believed not in him notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the mighty works which they ſaw him do, and this was a partial but not a total nor an incurable hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to all, nor ſo far as we know to the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> themſelves, but there were means ſtill uſed to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, which would have been all in vain and to no purpoſe, if they had been under an irrecoverable and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial hardneſs, and it had not been on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>blindneſs</hi> or hardneſs <hi>in part which had happened to Iſrael, Rom.</hi> 11.25. or to the <hi>Jews.</hi> And we ſhall ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture too far out of our depth, if we offer to ſay that God made uſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny means and remedies to convince and convert the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Scribes</hi> and the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> when he had appointed and decreed that none of thoſe ſhould have any effect or good operation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, this will hardly be conſiſtent with the Goodneſs and Mercy, or with the Truth and Sincerity of the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:103342:127"/>Bleſſed God, nor does he ever for any one Sin, but for a long obſtinate courſe of many provoking Sins continued in irreclaimably againſt the Methods of Divine Grace, give up any Perſon to hardneſs of Heart.</p>
                  <p>There remains, I confeſs, another way by which a Sin may become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable, and that is by being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted by God from the general Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and Covenant of Pardon which he hath made with Mankind. He who has all Sovereign Power, and an entire Right of Puniſhment, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whoſe Free Grace and Arbitrary Favour all Pardon and Forgiveneſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, may except what Sin he pleaſes out of his General Act of Grace and Proclamation of Pardon and Indemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but this ſurely ſhould be done particularly and by name, and in the very Act and Proclamation it ſelf, there in the very Charter and Covenant of Grace which God has ſigned with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, this ought to be expreſly exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and whether this Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt be ſo or no is the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, or whether this expreſſion of our Saviours concerning it, <hi>that it ſhall not be forgiven,</hi> may be mollified and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:103342:127"/>underſtood not in the utmoſt rigour of the Word, but as a great many of the beſt Interpreters of Scripture have judged, particularly St <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> of old, and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> of late, that this Sin ſhall hardly and not without great difficulty be forgiven, and not ſo ſoon or ſo eaſily as other Sins, that it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes and proceeds from ſuch a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Mind that is more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and more hard to be cured than any other diſtempers it is ſubject to, but yet that 'tis not quite impoſſible, as the words literally taken ſeem to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. I ſhall offer you the Reaſons that plead for this Opinion, and then deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what is moſt ſafe and ſatisfying in this matter.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is very uſual in Scripture to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent a thing that is very hard and difficult, as if it were utterly impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and never could be. This our Saviour himſelf does in the caſe of the Rich Mans entering into the Kingdom of Heaven; to expreſs the hardneſs of it, he does it by a thing that is utterly impoſſible, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.24. <hi>It is eaſier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God,</hi> And ſo does the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:103342:128"/>Prophet alſo make uſe of a Natural impoſſibility to repreſent the great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of a Mans turning from a long courſe and cuſtom of ſinning, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23. <hi>Can the Aethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his ſpots, then may ye alſo do good that are accuſtomed to do evil.</hi> Not but it is poſſible, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thoſe Proverbial expreſſions, that a Man who has been accuſtomed to do evil a very great while may yet be brought off from his Sins, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a good Man, or elſe all the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations to Repentance, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Goſpel are in vain, and ſo may a good Man become a very bad one too, and fall from his own ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs, and become guilty of abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Sins: As <hi>David</hi> did that was a Man after Gods own Heart, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that St. <hi>John</hi> in the ſame way and manner of expreſſion with theſe, declares concerning him, 1 <hi>Ep.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit ſin; for his ſeed remaineth in him: and he cannot ſin becauſe he is horn of God.</hi> That Phraſe, <hi>he cannot,</hi> denotes not an utter impoſſibility, for the Prophet as well as Experience too plainly ſhow the contrary, that <hi>a
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:103342:128"/>righteous man may turn from his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and commit iniquity, and dye in it, Ezek.</hi> 18.26. Things are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo expreſt in Scripture, as they often are alſo amongſt Men, as if there were no hopes, nor no probable means of effecting a thing, when yet there are very certain ones, as in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.25. not a little pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to this, <hi>If one man ſin againſt another the judge ſhall judge him, but if a man ſin againſt the Lord, who ſhall intreat for him?</hi> Not that there is no Advocate, nor no way of interceding with God when a Man thus ſins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, but to ſhow the guilt and danger of it above the other. That place of the <hi>Hebrews, chap.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>For it is impoſſible for thoſe who were once enlightened,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If they ſhall fall away to renew them again to Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; that</hi> is by very good Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters thought to denote only great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and not impoſſibility in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt rigour and ſtrictneſs, which it is plain none of the other Phraſes, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may ſound, muſt be taken in; and therefore this expreſſion of our Saviour concerning the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, they think may be mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:103342:129"/>and underſtood with the ſame largeneſs and latitude as thoſe, and to import only thus much, that it ſhall be more difficultly repented of, and ſo more hardly forgiven than any other Sins.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Both the firſt part of this Verſe, <hi>That all manner of ſin; and blaſphemies ſhall be forgiven unto men,</hi> and many other abſolute and unconditional Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, or Threatnings, or like Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in Scripture, muſt not, they ſay, be too rigorouſly and literally underſtood; for if they are, the truth which is now evident in them, as they are taken with that fairneſs and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and thoſe ſuppoſals which muſt go along with them, will be forced out, and they will become falſe; for it will not be true, <hi>that all manner of ſins and blaſphemies ſhall be forgiven unto men,</hi> for then none ſhould be damned of made miſerable in another World. And when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>They that do ſuch things ſhall not inherit the kingdom of Heaven, Gal.</hi> 5.21. it muſt not be made a certain and general concluſion from thence, that none who were ever guilty of any one of thoſe Sins, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he there gives us a black Catalogue
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:103342:129"/>ſhall ever be ſaved, nor become capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of entering into Heaven, but that they ſhall not be ſo without Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Amendment, though that is not there mentioned, nor any proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning that is ſo much as inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in that place; nor is that, tho' neceſſary, Condition to the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of every Sin expreſt or put down in our Saviours general Declaration, <hi>that all manner of ſins and blaſphemies ſhall be forgiven unto men,</hi> but it is without all Controverſie to be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and the ſame allowances that are to be made to all theſe and the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Scripture, without which, if they are ſtrained over-rigorouſly, they would not be true, theſe they think reaſonable to apply to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours expreſſion concerning this Sin, and that where it is ſaid <hi>not to be forgiven, that is,</hi> not without a very particular and full Repentance of it. And to ſtrengthen this a little further, they obſerve that there is another Phraſe and Expreſſion concerning this Sin, uſed by our Saviour, where the ſenſe muſt not be forced ſo far as the words would ſeem to carry it, and that is this, <hi>That it ſhall not be forgiven nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:103342:130"/>in this world, nor in the world to come, Matth.</hi> 12.32. As if our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our did thereby intimate that any Sins ſhould be pardoned in another World, which are not in this. Some Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters think that ſome of the <hi>Jews</hi> had this opinion as the Papiſts now have, and that our Saviour therefore uſed the expreſſion to take off all hopes from them that had ſuch a vain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and levelled his words againſt that, but I rather think this to be the plain ſenſe, that it was only a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Phraſe among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the thing ſhould not be, or never be, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard to any ſuch opinion, which we have not ſufficient authority to prove the <hi>Jews</hi> had, but only that Death they thought was a kind of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation for ſome Sins in their Life: However this Phraſe muſt have ſome allowance made for the words of it, and ſo they would have the other.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another Reaſon for the abating the ſeverity of the Expreſſion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, is that there are other Sins which ſeem equal to this in guilt and heinouſneſs, which are yet all decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be pardonable; and thoſe not only the moſt wilful Sins, againſt
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:103342:130"/>Natural Light as well as Revealed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but againſt Chriſtianity and even the Holy Ghoſt; ſuch as were thoſe of the Heathen World, deſcribed <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. and yet they were received into the Chriſtian Religion, and made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Chriſtian Covenant, as 'tis plain many of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> alſo were, whoſe Names were put in the Liſt of the vileſt Sinners, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. And the Apoſtle expreſly tells them, <hi>That ſuch were ſome of them;</hi> to wit, <hi>Fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, abuſers of themſelves with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, thieves, covetous, drunkards, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilers, extortioners, ver.</hi> 9.10. and yet theſe very Men <hi>were waſhed, were ſanctified, were juſtified in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by the Spirit of our God, ver.</hi> 11. And St. <hi>Peters</hi> denyal of his Maſter after he had ſeen all his Miracles, and been ſo fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by them that he was, as he had confeſt, the Son of God, was a very great Sin, yet upon his repenting and weeping bitterly for it, it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given. Nay, they who treated our Saviour with the baſeſt and the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt uſage, and at laſt barbarouſly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him, our Saviour prayed his Father even to forgive theſe; and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:103342:131"/>therefore that greateſt of Sins, the putting an innocent Man to death, and Crucifying the very Son of God, this was not excluded from Pardon, but the very Blood that they thus vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanouſly ſhed was an Expiation for the very Sin of ſhedding of it. And if it be ſaid, that theſe however great and horrid Sins, yet were not ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately Sins againſt the Holy Ghoſt, againſt whom peculiarly this unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable Sin is committed, if we care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully examine the Bible we ſhall find a great many Sins and Provocations, chiefly if not directly againſt him, wherein he was particularly affronted, if not blaſphemed and reproached, and yet not unpardonable. St. <hi>Paul</hi> owns himſelf a Blaſphemer as well as a Perſecutor, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. and wherein can we think his Blaſphemy conſiſted? not in blaſpheming God, the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for he was a very ſtrict and Religious Worſhipper of him according to the Law, and the ſtricteſt Sect of the <hi>Jews;</hi> but it muſt be in blaſpheming Chriſtianity, and ſuch things as were done to the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and confirmation of that. And nothing ſeems to be ſo likely a ſubject
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:103342:131"/>of his Blaſphemy as the Miracles of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, becauſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was ſo ſtrong an Argument for the Chriſtian Religion, which could not well be reproached, unleſs thoſe were evil ſpoken of, and yet he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Mercy, and became the great inſtance of an hearty Penitent, and a zealous Convert. But we have more particular Inſtances of ſome Sins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Ghoſt himſelf, that tended to reproach and diſhonour him in a high meaſure, and yet are no where declared to be unpardonable. <hi>Ananias</hi> is ſaid <hi>to lye to the Holy Ghoſt, Acts</hi> 5.3. and to <hi>tempt the Spirit of the Lord, ver.</hi> 9. and vertually to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his Knowledge and Omniſcience, by denying part of the Money for which he had ſold his Eſtate that was devoted by him to the Church; and <hi>Simon Magus</hi> who offered Money that he might purchaſe the Holy Ghoſt, and thought a few pieces of Silver a juſt Price, and valuable Conſideration for him, and that the Power of God might be bought and ſold for a little Money; He did reproach the Holy Ghoſt, by which the Apoſtles did their Miracles, in the higheſt manner;
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:103342:132"/>
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 8.19. and therefore St. <hi>Peter</hi> very ſeverely reproves him, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. <hi>Thy money periſh with thee, becauſe thou haſt thought that the gift of God may be purchaſed with money.</hi> And that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion might have been thought to have put him into an irreverſible ſtate of Ruine and Perdition, had not St. <hi>Peter</hi> added what ſhows it to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>Repent therefore of this thy wickedneſs, and pray God, if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.</hi> And there is another Inſtance that ſeems as great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate a reproach to the Holy Ghoſt as what the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were guilty of, in charging the Miracles which Chriſt wrought by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt to an Evil Spirit, and that was the mocking at the Diſciples upon whom the Holy Ghoſt was poured out on the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> as if they had been inſpired with new Wine, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.13. and yet this has no Mark ſet upon it by the Apoſtles, whereby it can be certainly known to be either the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt meant by our Saviour, or a Sin that was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable.</p>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:103342:132"/>
                  <p n="4">4. As there are other Sins that ſeem equal to this yet certainly Pardonable, ſo there are expreſſions concerning ſome other Sins which ſeem as much to exclude them from all hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and to paſs as ſevere and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate a Sentence upon them, as Chriſt does here upon this; and yet the beſt Interpreters think they admit of an abatement and mitigation, as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4.5, 6. <hi>For it is impoſſible for thoſe who were once enlightened, and have taſted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, and have taſted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come: If they ſhall fall away, to renew them again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to repentance, ſeeing they crucifie to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Son of God afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame.</hi> And again, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26. <hi>For if we ſin wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſin.</hi> The Sin that is meant in both theſe places is moſt probably the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatizing from and renouncing of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, which the Chriſtians were then in great danger of in thoſe times of Danger and Perſecution, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtles had all reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:103342:133"/>it as the moſt hazardous and guilty, and to let them know that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had once fallen from their Baptiſm, they could not be renewed by another Baptiſm, and after they had rejected the Sacrifice of Chriſt, there was no other Sacrifice to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be offered for their Sins, nor was Chriſt to dye more than once: This was indeed a very horrid Sin, and to thoſe eſpecially who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably had extraordinary Gifts commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to them, as the Phraſes there uſed ſeem to denote. Theſe might well be charged with thoſe tremendous expreſſions, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. <hi>That they had trodden under foot the Son of God, and counted the blood of the covenant where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were ſanctified, an unholy thing, and done deſpite unto the Spirit of Grace.</hi> But yet the Primitive Church, how ſevere ſoever it was at firſt to the <hi>Lapſi</hi> in denying them Communion after they had Apoſtatized, yet it was the ſame alſo to many other Sins, to whom it utterly denyed the Communion of the Church for ever as well as to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, though the Perſons were never ſo penitent who committed them: And whilſt they kept to this moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:103342:133"/>Diſcipline which they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced afterwards to abate, yet they did not peremptorily ſentence thoſe peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Apoſtates, nor any others, to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Perdition, but left them to the Mercy of God, for which they would not engage to be Sponſors or Sureties, as not being able to aſcertain them of it; and this is the moſt, I think, of what St. <hi>John</hi> ſayes of <hi>the ſin unto death: I do not ſay that we ſhall pray for it,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.16. <hi>i. e.</hi> we cannot have ſuch an aſſurance that God will hear the Prayers for that as for other Sins, and therefore we cannot ſo confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encourage Men to pray for it, tho' he does not at all forbid them to do it. This <hi>Sin unto death</hi> was very likely alſo to be Apoſtacy from Chriſtianity to the Idolatry of the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> or the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and that was certainly a very deadly Sin, and ſuch as was not to have the benefit of the Prayers of the Church; but to ſay that this would never be Pardoned, after St. <hi>Peters</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal of his Maſter was, and after the Church did frequently admit the <hi>Lapſi</hi> at leaſt to Lay-Communion, I think we ought to have a more plain and manifeſt Revelation of the Will of
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:103342:134"/>God in that matter than we have from that difficult place. However from theſe three places which come the neareſt to this Sin, though there is no mention of it in any of them, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that either other Sins, as well as that particular one of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> may be repreſented unpardonable, or elſe that thoſe expreſſions which are uſed to ſet out the guilt of thoſe Sins are yet to be mollified and abated. But,</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The Evangelical Covenant of Pardon and Forgiveneſs being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt in ſuch general and large terms as extend univerſally to all manner of Sins, without any exception whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; and there being no one Sin whatever exempted out of that in the Charter it ſelf, or in the Form of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution preſcribed by Chriſt <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.29. <hi>John</hi> 20.23. they think it is more agreeable to ſay, that no one particular Sin, how great ſoever, is unpardonable by the Goſpel; and that this will be a greater force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to thoſe many Promiſes of the Goſpel, than to mitigate the ſeverity of thoſe expreſſions which ſeem to ſpeak otherwiſe of ſome Sins, and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:103342:134"/>particularly of that againſt the Holy Ghoſt: And therefore to come to a reſolution in this matter that may be ſafe and ſatisfying, I ſhall do it very briefly in two particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſay, That either for thoſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons the Expreſſion here may be molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and not taken in its literal and rigorous ſenſe, but ſo as to import the great guilt of the Sin and difficulty of its Pardon, but not the utter impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. Or elſe,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That there were ſome particular circumſtances in that Sin of the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,</hi> which make it a Sin proper to them in thoſe times, and ſuch as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are not now in any poſſible dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of committing; for though we have ſufficient Reaſons to believe the truth of Chriſtianity upon the account of the Miracles done by our Saviour, and we have an unqueſtioned aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the truth of thoſe from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Hiſtory, and univerſal Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and Tradition, yet we cannot have that ocular evidence, and viſible demonſtration of them that the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> had; and therefore if any of the <hi>Jews</hi> in our dayes who have ſwallowed many of them this blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:103342:135"/>account of Chriſt and his Miracles, that he did them all by the Power of Magick which he learned in <hi>Egypt,</hi> if they do now vent this horrid Calumny, yet I think they are not ſo perfectly Criminal, nor is this ſo high a degree of villany in them as it was in their Fore-fathers, who ſaw the very Miracles done before their faces, which is the higheſt evidence that can be. And unleſs the Perſon be in all thoſe circumſtances that they were, which would make him a great deal more inexcuſable, I queſtion whether he can be charged with this Sin. And therefore as a Concluſion from the whole, and as the moſt uſeful remark from this Subject, I ſhall adviſe theſe two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) That no Sinner be diſcourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Leaving his Sins howſoever great, nor from Hopes of the Divine Mercy, upon any ungrounded Fears that he is fallen into this Sin, and ſo is in a hopeleſs, irrecoverable, unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable ſtate. By what has been ſaid it appears that no one now has reaſon to do this; and it is certainly the greateſt deſign of the Goſpel and our Saviours coming into the World, to
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:103342:135"/>perſwade Mankind that were ſunk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſaddeſt Sins and Wickedneſs, to Repent and Forſake all their Evil wayes: And there is no ſuch means to encourage to this, as to aſſure them of the Divine Mercy, and the certain Forgiveneſs of all of them if they do. 'Tis this is the way to bring Men in to their Duty and Allegiance, when their Governour proclaims an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Act of Grace for what is paſt; whereas the being cut off from all ſuch hopes, makes them go on, and grow more deſperate; and 'tis by this Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Mercy of God, held forth to all Sinners, and ſo fully diſplayed in the Goſpel and the Death of Chriſt, that we are led to Repentance, and therefore it ought by no means to be leſſened or diminiſhed unleſs we would make God leſs Good than he is, and hinder Men from ever becoming better.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) Let us take care to avoid all manner of wilful Sin, and eſpecially all thoſe great ones that come near and any way approach to this Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. A very wilful Sin, in a Chriſtian eſpecially, is in ſome fenſe a Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt;
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:103342:136"/>'tis a <hi>grieving, a quenching, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting the Spirit,</hi> in the language of Holy Scripture. That Bleſſed Spirit is concerned as the great promoter of Vertue and Goodneſs in the World, and as the great Principle of it in the Hearts of Men, and whenever we do any wicked thing we offer violence to that, and by our rude and vicious carriage we affront, and grieve, and at laſt baniſh and drive away that Bleſſed Gueſt out of our Souls. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is Wicked and Sinful is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Pure and Excellent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it is highly offenſive to him; and if we go on in a courſe of long and cuſtomary Wickedneſs, we ſin the more againſt him, and come the nearer to that ſad and wretched ſtate that is unpardonable. I do not think indeed that any one Sin, or particular Act of any Sin whatever puts us into that condition, but as every Sickneſs and Indiſpoſition of Body is a tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to Death and Mortality, ſo every wilful Sin is a corruption of the Mind, and an approach to a ſtate of Spiritual Death. And there are ſome Sins that bring this ſooner upon us, as the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt our Conſciences, and the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:103342:136"/>ſenſe of our own Minds, an oppoſing the Truth that is evident to us, a ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing at Religion and making a mock of Sin, an abuſing the Scriptures and ridiculing the Holy Word of God, an obſtinate reſiſtance of all the motions of Gods Holy Spirit upon our Minds. Theſe and ſuch like groſs and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate impieties, though I do not think they are any of them the very Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Ghoſt, for that ought not to be extended further than we have a warrant from Scripture, yet they are ſo many approaches as it were to it, and have more of the ill ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of that upon them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought eſpecially to avoid them leſt they bring us by degrees into that ſad ſtate which is unpardonable; for though one Sin, I believe, do not do this, yet a great many may, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch as thoſe which do ſo waſte the Conſcience, and corrupt the Mind as to make it uncurable. And this is the ſaddeſt State and Condition in the World, next to the State of Hell and Damnation, tho' it be not the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</p>

                  <p>THE right underſtanding of our ſelves is very neceſſary to the right underſtanding of Religion. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is fitted and adapted to Humane Nature in its preſent ſtate and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in this World, and is deſigned not to deſtroy it but to perfect and improve it, and raiſe it to its true Happineſs and Perfection. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be like the Angels in Heaven, nor like pure and glorious Spirits whilſt we live here upon Earth, and have Bodies of Fleſh and Blood united to our Souls. God who made us, and knows our Frame, did not intend to deſtroy and undo his own Creation by the Precepts of Religion, nor make us ceaſe to be Men by becoming Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. We find indeed in our ſelves a great many weakneſſes and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſtrong paſſions and ſenſual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, which if we did not wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly govern would be great occaſions of Sin to us, and if we let them looſe
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:103342:138"/>would carry us into a thouſand Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs as well as Sins and Wickedneſſes. They who give the reins to thoſe, and the full ſwinge to their Natural Luſts and Paſſions run into all Vice and Debauchery, <hi>and commit all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs with greedineſs.</hi> And the beſt of Men cannot be wholly free from that Original Concupiſcence, and thoſe Senſual Motions and Deſires that are not alwayes agreeable to Reaſon and Religion; but they complain of this <hi>bondage of corruption,</hi> and this <hi>body of death,</hi> which they cannot be delivered from, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.21. and 7.24. Grace and Religion, though it gives us ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Principle, and conveys new pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of a Divine and Spiritual Life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Souls, yet whilſt the Animal and Senſual Life remains, and whilſt we are compounded of Fleſh and Blood as well as Spirit and Reaſon, and have a Carnal as well as Spiritual Principle in us, there will be a mighty ſtruggle and a great conteſt between thoſe two, and a kind of civil war in our breaſts between thoſe different Parties, and which of thoſe ſhall be uppermoſt, and have the chief Power, and gain the Victory, is the great
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:103342:138"/>point, and the great concern of all Vertue and Religion; ſince in all of us, as the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>The Fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the Fleſh, and theſe are contrary one to the other, ſo that we cannot do the things that we would, Gal.</hi> 5.17. And this we know by Experience as well as by Revelation. Now this Concupiſcence that remaineth in good Men is often matter of great trouble to them, and they know not what to judge of it, or how far it is a Sin and ought to be Repented of, and what way they may beſt overcome it. I ſhall therefore to clear and ſatisfie their thoughts about this matter of the ſtruggle or Luſting between the Fleſh and Spirit, ſhow theſe three things.</p>

                     </gap>ects, to conſent to what is ſinful, or commit any thing that is forbidden by a Divine Law. The worſt of Men may have ſome ineffectual Deſires and good Motions ſtirred up in their Souls now and then, and it may be with ſome force and violence that they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the tender ſenſe of their own
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:103342:139"/>Minds, and the ſtrugglings and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes of their own Conſciences, and their own Spirits and the Spirit of God may ſtrive within them againſt their Luſts and ſinful Inclinations, but the latter is too hard for them, and the Temptations of Sin and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs prevail over all their faint De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, good Wiſhes, Purpoſes or Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions. 'Tis certain no Man can be wicked but againſt the ſenſe of his own Mind, the ſmiting of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, the convictions of his own Reaſon and Judgment, and a ſtrong inward Principle that makes Vice troubleſome and uneaſie to him at its firſt commitment, before he has worn off Natural Shame and Innocence, and is hardened by Cuſtom, and long continuance. We have Naturally in us a Principle of Vertue as well as of Vice; they are both indeed blended and mixt in our Nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Spirit does as truly Luſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Fleſh, and has ſtrong Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Motions againſt that, as the Fleſh hath againſt the Spirit. We have the Natural Seeds of Probity, good Nature, Pity, Charity, Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Modeſty, and other Vertues
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:103342:140"/>ſown in our Hearts, and appearing in the firſt tender indications of undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed Nature, in Children and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, as well as the ſeeds of Vice and Wickedneſs, and all manner of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and Corruption that grow up afterwards in Mens Lives. There is an Original Luſt and Concupiſcence to Good as well as to Evil; and as there is an Original Sin in our Nature, in a true ſenſe and meaning, ſo there is an Original Righteouſneſs ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in us, as not only Nature and Experience, but St. <hi>Pauls</hi> words here of the two Luſtings of the Fleſh and Spirit, do plainly ſuppoſe and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. But becauſe ſome have thought that the firſt Motions of Concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, or the meer feeble and ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Luſtings and Deſires of the Fleſh after Evil or undue Objects, is truly and properly a Sin, I ſhall clear and conſider that Point, and take off the trouble that ſome have thereupon in their Minds.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Theſe meer Luſtings or firſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Concupiſcence cannot be Sin, becauſe they are Natural, and reſult from our very Frame, and Make, and Conſtitution; and as an Argument
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:103342:140"/>that they are ſo, and ſo come from pure Mechaniſm of Body, and the Temperament of Blood and Spirits, they are the ſame both in us and in Brutes who have ſuch Bodies as we have, and who never were capable of Sinning or Falling, or being puniſh'd as ſuch. Now nothing that is purely Natural can be Sinful, for as ſuch it is the work of God and part of his own Creation which he has pronounced to be good, and it plainly ſerves ſuch good ends and deſigns for the benefit of the World, as God thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and as are wiſely appointed by him. 'Tis therefore making God the Author of Evil, or with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Hereticks, making an Evil Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to be our Creator, to ſuppoſe any thing in us that is purely Natural to be Sinful.</p>
                  <p n="2">2, Theſe Luſtings and firſt Deſires were in our firſt Parents before the Fall (for they are only the inclination of our Animal Nature to its proper good, and a ſuitable Object) when they beheld the forbidden Fruit, <hi>and ſaw that it was good for food, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to the eyes, and a tree to be deſired, Gen.</hi> 3.4. Had they gone no further
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:103342:141"/>but only ſeen it, and thought it fair and lovely to the eye, but checked this their Deſire and Luſt after it with the Conſideration of Gods Prohibition, and of the Puniſhment he had threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt the eating of it, they had not then loſt their Innocence, nor bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Gods Command, nor incurred the grievous Penalty of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thoſe Natural Deſires and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations were even in our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>who was in all things tempted like unto us, yet without ſin, Heb.</hi> 4.15. Who as he increaſed in Wiſdom and Stature, and grew up as a Man, ſo he hungred and thirſted, and felt pain, and was extremely ſorrowful even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Death, and prayed <hi>that the bitter Cup might paſs from him;</hi> which all ſhowed that he took our Nature with its Weakneſſes and Infirmities upon him, and that thoſe are not Sins unleſs they go further, and make us do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unlawful which he never did; but his Vertue would not have been ſo great, nor could he have been tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Devil, or rewarded by his Father for his Obedience, had not he had the ſame Natural Deſires and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:103342:141"/>that belong to Fleſh and Blood.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Theſe firſt Motions are unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and not under the power or command of our Will, any more than ſuch ſenſations and perceptions from Objects ſuited to ſuch Faculties and inward Powers; ſo that we can no more help ſuch Motions and Deſires ariſing from ſuch cauſes, than the ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things when they are ſet before our Eyes, or having our Ears ſtruck with ſuch ſounds as are near us. The Mind is as ſuddenly ſtruck with ſuch a Deſire and Inclination from ſuch an Object making impreſſion upon it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to its Nature and Capacity, as it is by our outward Senſes. Indeed the Mind can judge of this afterwards, and has a power to determine it ſelf as it pleaſes, either to chooſe or refuſe ſuch a Motion offered to it, and this we call Will; and if it does chooſe it, and conſent to it, then as St. <hi>James</hi> ſayes, <hi>Luſt hath conceived and brought forth ſin, James</hi> 1.15. but it is not Sin before it hath thus conceived and brought it forth; and though the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be not yet produced, yet when the Mind has conſented to it, from thence
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:103342:142"/>it derives its Sinfulneſs, and all its Blame and Guilt, and there wants no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it ſelf but only Power and Opportunity, which are things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, to bring it into Act: So that as a weight is the ſame, though its tendency downwards be ſtop'd by what it lyes upon, ſo is the pravity of the Will when it conſents to an unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Deſire, though it be hindered from executing it. But I ſhall ſhow this further in the Second Head of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, namely;</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2ly,</hi> That theſe Luſtings and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of the Fleſh and the Spirit are the proper tryals of our Vertue, and the chief matter of our Obedience; and according as either of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon us, ſo we are fix'd in our Moral ſtate here, and our Eternal ſtate hereafter. The Fleſh ſollicites us with the temptations of Bodily Pleaſures and Delights, with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of the Animal Life, and the ſenſible and preſent good things of this World; and if we chooſe thoſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard to the Laws of Vertue, and Religion; if we are ſo fond of them that we will break through thoſe
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:103342:142"/>to obtain them, and prefer the ſhort gratifications of Sin and Fleſh for a ſeaſon before the better Pleaſures of Vertue and Innocence, and the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Rewards of them for ever, then our choice is fooliſh and unreaſonable, and our deſtruction wilful and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable. The Spirit propoſes to us the dictates of Wiſdom and Reaſon, and ſhows us both the folly and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of being thus governed by our lower Appetites, and being led away by thoſe like Brutes that have no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and not living up to the dignity of our Nature, and letting our Reaſon curb and controll thoſe ſenſual inclinations: And it further layes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us the great obligations of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the ſtrong and powerful conſiderations of another World, and by all theſe it prevails upon all that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly think and conſider, let their Carnal Inclinations be never ſo ſtrong, and the Luſtings of their Fleſh never ſo fierce and violent; tho' their firſt Motions cannot be quite hindered and ſuppreſt, and the fire of Concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence cannot be quite extinguiſh'd and put out, yet it may be kept under and hindered from ever blazing out, from
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:103342:143"/>ever gaining any conſent of the Will to what is unlawful, and from ever committing it by outward deed or action; and while it does ſo, it is ſafe though it be ſtill tryed, though it be in a ſtate of perpetual warfare, and the Fleſh be ſuch an inteſtine enemy as cannot be wholly deſtroyed, but like the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> its Luſts may be ſtill <hi>a thorn in our ſide to vex us, Num.</hi> 33. and <hi>to buffet us,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. yet we may ſtill maſter and conquer it, and keep it under, and make it ſubject as a Vaſſal to the Laws of Reaſon and Religion. It would be moe eaſie, and more happy, if we brought it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a condition that it could never ſtir, or rebel, or riſe up againſt the Spirit, but it may be as great Vertue, and greater Victory, and more highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardable to ſtruggle and overcome; and like <hi>Socrates,</hi> though by Nature and Conſtitution we are never ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and ill diſpoſed, yet to become otherwiſe by thought and Philoſophy, and to owe our Vertue though not to our temper yet to our care and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection, to the power of Grace and Religion: <hi>That</hi> will change our Hearts and our Tempers, and renew
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:103342:143"/>us inwardly in our Minds, and inſtead of ſtony Hearts, give us Hearts of Fleſh, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. and inſtead of Fleſhly and Earthly Deſires give us Spiritual and Heavenly ones, and whatever we are by Nature, make us meek and gentle, ſober and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, pure and chaſt, and entirely Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous by Principle, Habit and Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 'Tis very happy when a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Temper diſpoſes us to acquire thoſe Chriſtian Vertues; when the Soil is kindly, and fitted for them to take root and grow up in it, but we muſt prepare and cultivate it, and weed out thoſe corruptions that are in it, till we plant it with all thoſe Graces, and it bring forth thoſe Fruits of the Divine and Spiritual Life, though we are at never ſo much care and pains about them.</p>
                  <p>How we may bring the Spirit to prevail alwayes over the Fleſh, and to conquer the Luſtings of it, and by what means we may leſſen the Power of one, and increaſe that of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I am in the <hi>Third</hi> place to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Theſe Luſtings of the Fleſh, ſo far as Natural, are not Sinful, but
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:103342:144"/>but may be conſiſtent with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Principle of the Spirit when kept within due bounds, and governed by the Laws of Vertue and Religion. We cannot be without ſuch Paſſions, Appetites and Inclinations whilſt we have Body and Fleſh about us, and theſe are part of Gods Creation, and not made in vain, but put in us for good ends ſo far as they were deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God and Nature. They were not given us to torment and vex us with unſatisfied Deſires and impatient Appetites; like <hi>Tantalus</hi> his Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to have the daintieſt Fruit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and be ſet up to the Chin in a cool River, and yet not taſte the one, nor quench his thirſt with a drop of the other: No, Religion does not tye us up from any proper Natural En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments with a <hi>touch not, taſte not, handle not,</hi> but allowes us the ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gratifying our Natural Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and Deſires within the bounds of Vertue, Decency and Lawfulneſs. It lets us eat of all the Trees, and Fruits, and Dainties of this Earthly Paradiſe, only it keeps us from the forbidden Fruit, and ſuffers us not to gratifie our Deſires brutiſhly and unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:103342:144"/>and without regard to publick and private good, which is more to be regarded than any Mans particular humour or pleaſure. God therefore, as we are Rational Creatures who are to promote the univerſal Happineſs of the whole World, has given us ſuch Laws as conduce to that end, and we are alwayes to obſerve them, and not tranſgreſs the limits and preſcriptions by which he has bounded our Senſual Deſires and Inclinations, and without deſtroying them has made them uſeful and ſerviceable to the wiſe ends of his Providence. So that we are not bound with the <hi>Stoicks</hi> to root up thoſe, nor with the <hi>Aſceticks</hi> to deny our ſelves ſuch gratifications as are Innocent and Decent, Lawful and Uſeful. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We are to deſtroy the Exceſſes and Irregularities of them which are vicious, miſchievous and unbecoming; and this Religion means when it bids us <hi>mortifie our earthly members, and crucifie the Fleſh, with the Affections and Luſts; and pluck out a right eye, and cut off a right hand when they offend us,</hi> or draw us to Sin; not that we are to deſtroy hereby any part of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or any of the Paſſions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:103342:145"/>reſulting from it, but ſo far as they are unnatural and immoderate, inflamed and heightened by folly and fancy, and exceed the meaſures both of Nature and Reaſon, Vertue and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and exceed the bounds both of Humane and Divine Laws, ſo far we are to deſtroy, kill and mortifie them; for they become then miſchievous and pernicious to the World, and bring ſhameful and miſerable effects along with them, and are a reproach and a diſhonour to our Reaſon and our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as being contrary to and below both. The frame and make of our Bodies require to be ſuſtained with Meat and Drink, and the Natural Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites of Hunger and Thirſt are to be gratified with what is acceptable to the Taſte and Palate, but when this runs into Luxury, Gluttony and Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, when Vanity, Brutiſhneſs and Debauchery mixes it ſelf with our Meat and Drink, then theſe Natural Appetites are vicious and immoderate, forced beyond Nature by Folly, Fancy and Cuſtom, and our Table becomes a Snare and a Sin to us. We cannot but deſire the good things, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, the plenty, the riches of
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:103342:145"/>this World, for we ſee the uſefulneſs and the neceſſity of them to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Life, but to deſire them ſo immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately, as not to be content with a moderate competency and ſufficiency, with <hi>food and rayment,</hi> as the Apoſtle has fix'd a competency, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.8. with what anſwers the wants of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the circumſtances of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but to be alwayes craving after more without any uſe or occaſion, this is that immoderate deſire of Riches which we call Covetouſneſs; and ſo in other things 'tis the Exceſs, the Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularity, the immoderate and the vicious Abuſe, not the Natural Paſſion and Inclination it ſelf that is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, reſtrained and mortified.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To do this we muſt ſo check, and reſtrain, and deny even our Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Appetites that we may have the power and government alwayes over them: Now if we let them looſe, and lay the reins upon their neck, and let them take their utmoſt liberties, and go alwayes to the furtheſt bounds of what is lawful, they will hardly be kept in as they ought to be, but we ſhall walk upon the brink of danger and the ſide of a precipice, where
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:103342:146"/>it will be hard to eſcape falling ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and our Senſual Inclinations will grow more heady, ſtrong and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable by being alwayes indulged, and not uſed to a more ſevere diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and management, which all wiſe Men have therefore preſcribed by the Rules and Precepts of Mortification and Self-denyal.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To abate theſe Luſtings and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of the Fleſh, and increaſe and raiſe thoſe of the Spirit, let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how little and mean are the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and gratifications of the one in reſpect of thoſe of the other. How the one are low, ſordid and Brutiſh, the other Rational and Angelical, ſuch as the higheſt order of Beings next to God are capable of. How little is there in all the Riches, and Greatneſs, and State of this World, how much leſs in all the mad frollicks of Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, and all the beaſtlineſs and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of Brutiſh Luſts, in all thoſe things that make up Carnal Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and are the ſumme, as the Apoſtle reckons them up, of all that is in the World, <hi>The luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.16. How much greater

'Tis a vain fancy and opinion of the latter, whereby we raiſe our imagination and heighten our expectation of ſomething great and extraordinary in them, 'tis that kindles our Affections, and inflames our Deſires after them; but did we wiſely conſider how vain, and trifling, and inconſiderable they are, and how poor, and little, and ſhort, and ſorry gratifications they afford, this would wean us from ſuch weak fancies and opinions of them, and ſo ſlack and cool our Deſires and Luſtings after them.</p>

                  <p>Laſtly, We muſt uſe all Religious Means and Methods to mortifie and abate the Luſtings of the Fleſh, and ſtrengthen and increaſe thoſe of the Spirit by the Acts and Exerciſes of Religion, Piety and Devotion. 'Tis in the growth and prevalence of the latter lyes our Moral State, and the greateſt exerciſe of all Vertue, and in the right ordering and governing of our Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Appetites and Inclinations, ſo that we muſt uſe all poſſible Methods to keep the lower Appetites under, and obedient to the ſuperiour, and not let them dethrone our Reaſon, or diſobey Religion; and therefore we muſt uſe all the helps we can have from Religion and Philoſophy, and the Divine Grace and Aſſiſtance, to tame our inordinate Luſts by Faſting, by Watching by Prayer by due watchfulneſs and circumſpection over our ſelves, and over all the weak places of our Nature, that Sin do not enter in at ſome of thoſe inlets that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded, and do not ſurprize and eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſet us when we are unprepared and unarmed by Religion againſt the aſſaults of it; and there is nothing ſo
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:103342:147"/>helpful to this, and to increaſe and ſtrengthen our Spiritual Deſires ſo that they ſhall alwayes prevail over the Luſts of the Fleſh, as the conſtant and uninterrupted exerciſes of Piety and Devotion: Theſe give life, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, and nouriſhment to our Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Deſires, and keep them alwayes warm, and heated, and intent upon their proper Objects, whereas a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of thoſe begets a careleſneſs ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity and ſenſleſneſs of all thoſe things, and ſinks Men into a meer Senſual, and Animal, and Worldly, and Brutal Life. Nothing is therefore ſo proper to bring us to theſe Spiritual Deſires, and to make thoſe alwayes prevail over the Luſts of the Fleſh, as Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Piety, which raiſe the Mind to things above the Body, and above this World, and take off and abſtract the Soul from Senſual and Carnal En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, and make it live up as near as it can to that Life it ſhall have in Heaven, when it ſhall be all Spirit, and have no Fleſh or Luſts to contend with or be contrary to it.</p>

                  <p>THE greateſt part of our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs or Miſery lyes in our Minds and Spirits, in thoſe inward Faculties and Senſories which are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from our Body and outward Senſes. We feel very often more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or pain in thoſe diſtinct from the Body than the Body it ſelf is capable of; for theſe are quicker and more ſenſible than Matter and Body can be, and are the proper ſubject of percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any Pleaſure and Pain, and of all Rational Happineſs or Miſery. A Mans inward Thoughts do often give him more torment and uneaſineſs, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and diſquietude of Soul, and more real pain and miſery than any Bodily torment, or even Death it ſelf; and therefore ſome have choſen Death, and have willingly endured any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily pain rather than lye under the greater pain, agonies and horrours of their own Minds, and many that have been under thoſe, yet have felt an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:103342:149"/>ward joy comfort and ſatisfaction of Mind that has ſupported them under the worſt pains and ſufferings of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and the greateſt outward evils that could ever fall upon them, and their Minds and Spirits have been chearful and erect and deſpiſed the threatnings of Tyrants, and born the greateſt tortures of Body, and the hardeſt calamities of this World. Thus did all the Martyrs, and thus do many good Men and good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians enjoy an inward happineſs of Mind, a peace, and comfort, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of Conſcience under a painful and ſickly Body, a poor and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Condition, and under a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny outward Evils which they are here ſubject to; but there are ſome cloſer and more inward Evils felt by others, a guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and uneaſie Mind, a troubled and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet Conſcience, a ſcaring dread of a Divine Vengeance hanging over their heads, and a fearful expectation and looking for of Judgment, which ſhall devour them in a little time, <hi>theſe</hi> are ſuch dreadful Evils as ſink down a Mans Mind, and oppreſs it with an inſupportable burden greater than it can bear, and ſwallow it up in a gulph
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:103342:149"/>of unſpeakable and intolerable Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. This is the greateſt and the worſt of Miſeries, to which no other Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nor no other Evils here that we are ſubject to are comparable: As the Wiſe Man obſerves, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.14. <hi>The ſpirit of a man may ſuſtain his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, but a wounded ſpirit who can bear?</hi> I ſhall conſider three things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to ſuch a Wounded Spirit or Troubled Mind.</p>

                  <p n="1">I. All Worldly Evil, or all that we can call outward Miſery to a Chriſtian, is in reſpect of that but like a ſmall Wound to a ſound Body, a little ſcratch upon the Skin, which though it may pain a Man a little, and be ſomething uneaſie, yet may be well enough born, and will heal of it ſelf, or by the help of proper Remedies, ſo long as it touches not the Vitals, nor comes near the great Veſſels of Life; but inward
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:103342:150"/>Miſery the pain and anguiſh of a Mans own Mind cauſed by his Sins and an evil Conſcience, is like a dart ſtruck through his Liver, like a ſword piercing into his Bowels or his very Heart, like a prick upon a Nerve or the moſt tender and vital part of us, which puts us into Convulſions and Agonies, and ſcatters all the force and power of our Animal Spirits. When any outward Affliction falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a good Man, he has ſomething to ſupport himſelf, <hi>His heart</hi> ſtandeth firm, or is <hi>fixed truſting in the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 112.7. He has inward ſprings of Comfort riſing up in his Mind that ſupply it with freſh vigour, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow and refreſh it with conſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits. Under the greateſt loſſes and diſappointments here, he is ſure he cannot loſe Heaven if he take care to live well, nor be diſappointed of his expectations hereafter; and that at preſent he has a good Providence that will not leave him deſtitute or unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, but do what is beſt for him. Under the greateſt Calumny and Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that others may load him withal, which is as uneaſie as any thing to an ingenuous Mind, yet when a Mans
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:103342:150"/>Conſcience acquits and vindicates him, though all the World ſhould reproach and accuſe him, he has more peace from thence than diſturbance from all the noiſe and clamours of others. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the greateſt Sickneſs or the fears of Death, when that moſt terrible thing comes near him and ſtands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, though he may not be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without fear, yet he is not without hopes and comfort too; but now what ſhall a wicked Man do under all theſe, when his Mind is ſick as well as his Body, when Death ſcares him, and comes as he thinks, to torment him before his time, when he is afraid to dye, and yet thinks he muſt dye when ever he is a little ill, how often does ſuch an one dye? how often does he taſte the bitterneſs of Death? and how does he feel ſomething in his Mind worſe than Death to his Body, and the agonies of his Conſcience are the foretaſte of that ſecond and Eternal Death.</p>
                  <p>This ſhows how dreadful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable a Wounded Spirit is, which is the ſecond thing I was to conſider, but I have prevented my ſelf in ſome meaſure with what I have ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:103342:151"/>and I dare not undertake fully to deſcribe that which they who have felt tell us it is impoſſible to repreſent, or give account of: What horrours they have been in, what diſmal ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours they have layn under, how they have ſuffered, as they imagine, the very torments of Hell, ſo great have the torments been above any thing elſe they could ever conceive or have an Idea of: So that I take this to be a ſenſible proof and demonſtration of a Hell; and if a Fiend had come from thence, and with the ghaſtlieſt look and the frightfulleſt appearance had told us what he felt there, it could not have been more convincing nor more affecting than what an old and deſpairing Sinner has both felt and confeſſed before he came thither; when God has made him preach this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out riſing from the dead, to warn his Brethren from the like Sins, and if it were poſſible to make them Repent, and not come into that ſtate of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when without going to the other World, or having a Meſſenger come from thence, they have ſeen and heard him cry out in the anguiſh of his Soul, like <hi>Cain, that his ſins and
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:103342:151"/>his puniſhment is greater than he can hear, Gen.</hi> 4.13. <hi>When the wrath of God has layn heavy upon him, and the arrows of the Almighty have ſtuck faſt in him, and he has been forced to drink of the wrath of the Almighty,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> expreſſes it, <hi>Job</hi> 21.20. Or as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> more fully, when he tells us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.8. <hi>In the hand of the Lord there is a cup, and the wine is red, it is full of mixture, and he poureth out of the ſame, the dregs whereof the wicked ſhall wring out, and drink of them.</hi> This bitter Cup of Gods Wrath mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all the poyſonous extracts of his own Sins, the wicked has been forced to drink, and has found that theſe are not vain and empty words, but real and ſenſible things, that we want proper words to expreſs; for all the terrible Idea's and repreſentations come very ſhort of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to be whip'd with Snakes, and laſh'd with Scorpions, to have hot burning Torches and flaming Swords held and applyed to us, which were the Metaphorical deſcriptions of theſe tortures of Conſcience, are far ſhort of what they are in themſelves, and nothing indeed can come nigh the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:103342:152"/>ſenſe of them, nor is what we feel in pain or pleaſure to be ever drawn fully and to the life in picture.</p>
                  <p>When a Man feels ſomething in himſelf that nothing elſe is like, when his Soul is overwhelmed with the deep Paſſions of remorſe, anguiſh and deſpair, when God hides his Face and takes away all Comfort from him, when he has no more hopes of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and judges himſelf as incapable of it as the damned in Hell, when Gods Spirit has left him, ſo that he can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pray nor do any thing to relieve himſelf, but lyes as a condemned Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, a Malefactor ſentenced, paſt all hopes of Pardon, and only expecting Puniſhment, and the laſt ſtroke of Vengeance, this is a ſad, a deplorable condition which I have known many a Sinner in under a Wounded Spirit, and had one great inſtance before me when I was writing this.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Wounds are not felt indeed by many a Sinner in the heat of Blood, in the career of his Luſts, and the hot perſuit of his Sins, when in his high frolicks and jovial diverſions he drowns the noiſe of his Conſcience, or lulls it aſleep with charming Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:103342:152"/>or full Cups, or ſome unthinking madneſs, but it will awake one time, or other, and like a ſleeping Lyon when 'tis rouſed up by ſome Judgment, by ſome Sickneſs, or Affliction, it will fall terribly upon him with rage and fury, and tear and conſume him; then all the wounds which ſin gave it will bleed afreſh, and it will feel them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, unleſs they have been cured by a timely repentance; if they have feſtered, and gangrened, and mortified the Soul for a time, yet when it comes to it ſelf it will feel them with unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible pain and anguiſh, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can aſſwage. I mean when a Man has ſin'd away his Life, and Death and his Sins are ſet together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him and 'tis hard to know which is the more terrible. When the Sting of Death ſwelled up with Sin and Guilt ſtrikes as deep into a Man's Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and wounds his Spirit, as Death it ſelf ſtrikes into his Body with its fatal dart, ſo that he ſuffers a double death at the ſame time, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual far more painful than the Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I take a Wounded Spirit here in the higheſt and moſt common ſenſe; and though when a Mans Spirit is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:103342:153"/>and ſunk with any thing 'tis very hard to bear it, which may be the ſenſe of the Wiſe Mans words in the forequoted place, when the ſtrength of a Mans Mind is loſt which ſhould ſupport him under all his infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities that he is ſubject to from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, yet nothing does ſo ſink it, ſo wound and deſtroy it as Sin and Guilt, eſpecially when it is come to ſuch a degree, and to ſuch a ſad condition as we commonly mean by a Wounded Spirit; <hi>i. e.</hi> a Mind deeply pierced with the ſenſe of its own Guilt, and of Gods Anger upon it. This like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe admits of degrees, and in ſome caſes 'tis a very happy thing for a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and 'tis to be ſure alwayes a juſt Puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall therefore in the Third place briefly conſider what is the proper Cure and Remedy of ſuch a wounded Spirit or troubled Mind; for there is no Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Illneſs but what is curable if we take it in time, by Religion; no Wound of Soul but what there is Balm for in <hi>Gilead,</hi> in Chriſtianity; there is no Diſeaſe too great for our Heavenly Phyſician, but what the Goſpel has a proper and certain Remedy for, if we
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:103342:153"/>duely and timely apply it. A Man may tarry too long indeed, and not uſe the Phyſick till it be too late, till Death comes and puts an end to the time of Tryal, and the time of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; and then a Wounded Spirit, <hi>i. e.</hi> the extremeſt Sorrow for a Mans Sins, the deepeſt Contrition of Soul for them, cannot come up to true Goſpel Repentance to which there is a certain promiſe of Pardon and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, for that is only upon turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, and leaving all our Sins, and leading a new Life, and bringing forth the Fruits of Repentance by Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Goſpel for the future, which is a neceſſary condition by the terms of the Goſpel which he cannot perform whom God cuts off before he can do it; and therefore ſuch an one muſt be left to the Infinite Mercy and Righteous Judgment of God, to be dealt with by ſuch meaſures as are not within the Covenant of Grace, or the Terms of the Goſpel, for by thoſe I cannot ſee any title he has to Pardon: But in other Caſes a Wounded Spirit may be the greateſt Mercy, and even the very beginning of Health, or of a Cure to a Soul, when God does not
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:103342:154"/>ſuffer a Man to go on ſenſleſly in his Sins, till he come to a ſeered Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and a reprobate Senſe, and to hardneſs of Heart and blindneſs of Mind, but by ſome methods of his Grace and Providence alarums his Conſcience and awakens his ſtupid Mind, and brings his almoſt ſenſleſs and ſtupified Soul to ſome Spiritual ſenſe of his condition. Then his Soul will be wounded as <hi>Davids</hi> was when he reflects upon thoſe Sins which he committed without conſideration, and he will be ſore ſtruck and ſmitten as every Penitent muſt, at the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his evil wayes. All Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is ſuch a wounding of the Soul as makes its Heart bleed within it, and its Blood and Spirits melt into Tears and Sorrow for what it has done; 'tis not ſuch an eaſie thing as moſt men think it to be; 'tis ſuch a Pain, ſuch a Wound to the Soul, that the Pleaſure of the greateſt Sin is but a poor trifle to it, and no man that rightly underſtood it would venture upon any Sin from the reſerved hopes of it. Repentance is a bitter Remedy made up of very ſtrong and unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ingredients, and we muſt go
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:103342:154"/>through a long courſe to purge out the old Diſeaſe and take away the root of it; ſo that before a wicked mind can be cured by it, it muſt be cut, and lanced, and wounded, and have very ſevere applications made to it. The work of Regeneration or the New Birth cannot be wrought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out many pangs or throwes, nor does God ever almoſt bring a bad man to become a good one without ſome trouble and diſorder of Mind. There is a trouble of Mind indeed which is exceſſive and unreaſonable, for every Sinner ought in ſome meaſure to be troubled in Mind and he has not a due ſenſe of his Sins if he is not, but there is a trouble of Mind which takes away the hopes of Mercy and throwes Men into deſpair, which is commonly called a Wounded Spirit, and 'tis ſo in the higheſt degree; and whether there is any Remedy for that, and what it is, and what advice is to be given in ſuch a caſe, and what judgment to be made of it, I ſhall briefly conſider.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then this is often joyned with Melancholly of Body which is very hard to be cured, and till it be ſo it is
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:103342:155"/>apt to darken the Mind, and bring a cloud over the Spirits, and to fill the Soul with very black Idea's and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and to hinder it from mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true judgment of it ſelf or its own actions; and this is as pityable, and ought as much to be remedied by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick and Care, as other Diſeaſes of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, for I have known very good Perſons ſubject to it; and one of the beſt means to cure it is to know that this is one cauſe of that trouble of Mind, which will be ſo much abated when one is perſwaded from whence it often comes, or is heightened: For Melancholly is not curable by Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion or Divinity, and they who are ſubject to it ſhould take the more care of their lives that there be no true and great cauſe to fall in and joyn with the Melancholly of their Bodies, and they ſhould make a judgment of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their beſt tempers, and when their thoughts are cleareſt, and ſhould truſt others, and eſpecially their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Guides to judge for them, ſince they are ſo unfit generally to paſs judgment upon themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Trouble of Mind which makes Men deſpair of Mercy is moſt
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:103342:155"/>unreaſonable, and contrary to the whole tenour and deſign of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; for there is Pardon held out to the greateſt Sinner by the Blood of Chriſt, and to the greateſt Sin, or the greateſt number of Sins if we Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of them, and leave them, and become good Men before we dye. This is as certain as the Goſpel is true, and therefore no Man has any juſt cauſe to deſpair for the greateſt Sin or Sins, who is ſo heartily troubled for them that he would not for the World commit them again, and who reſolves never to do ſo by the Grace of God, but to practice the contrary Vertues, and who makes good this Reſolution by a Vertuous, and Pious, and Religious Life, this Man will as certainly be happy as if he had been alwayes innocent and never had offended God: I cannot ſay he will be in a ſtate as comfortable and free from trouble, though if he has thus Repented and become a good man, he has good reaſon to be ſo, but he will be as ſafe, and if he has ſtill ſome trouble of mind remaining upon the remembrance of his Sins though never ſo long paſt, and he cannot ſee the Pardon of them with the ſame
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:103342:156"/>certainty and evidence that he knows he committed them, yet this ſhall not hinder his Pardon nor affect his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation if he has truly and fully Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of them. For,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And Laſtly, This Trouble of Mind which proceeds from judging too hardly or ſeverely of himſelf is rather an Infirmity than a Sin, and God will not condemn a Man for it though he may condemn himſelf; for God will not condemn a Man unjuſtly though he ſhould unjuſtly condemn himſelf, much leſs becauſe he does ſo. Deſpair is indeed a ſad ſtate, but I cannot ſay it is alwayes a damnable Sin, or want of Faith as ſome think, for it may ariſe not from a disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Goſpel, or of the Divine Goodneſs, or the freeneſs and fullneſs of Gods Grace in and through Chriſt, but meerly from a falſe, and miſtaken, and too hard and humble an opinion of a Mans ſelf, and this is a fault not of a Mans Will but of his Judgment, and a weakneſs and imperfection in his Underſtanding for which he ſhall never be condemned by a Righteous God, but he will reverſe this falſe Judgment which he made of himſelf
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:103342:156"/>when he lived or when he dyed, and ſet it right in the Court of Heaven, and do Juſtice to him at the great Tribunal, though he did not do it to himſelf here. That God will judge Men according to their Works is plain in Scripture, but no where that I know, that he will do ſo according to their Thoughts, their vain Hopes, and preſumptuous or vain Fears, and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and Doubts, and even Deſpairs of themſelves. So that tho' this Trouble of Mind or this Wounded Spirit be a comfortleſs and unhappy ſtate, yet it truly depends upon the cauſe to make judgment of it, or to conclude any thing from it, and true and timely Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is the beſt and certaineſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for it.</p>

               <p>THE moſt wicked and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of Sinners who have any thoughts of their Souls and of another World, though they are not prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon by this to become better, yet make this reſerve and refuge to themſelves, that they will Repent hereafter at ſome time or other, and ſo eſcape the Wrath to come. They know and are very ſenſible, if they have not ſhaken off all Religion, and all thinking and conſidering of theſe things, that <hi>except they repent they ſhall all periſh;</hi> but they hope and intend to prevent this by the benefit of Repentance, and ſo make uſe of that not to bring them off from their Sins, but to encourage them in them, with hopes to avoid all the miſerable conſequences of them and yet live in
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:103342:157"/>them, and ſo by this priviledge of an after Repentance they ſet aſide the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent neceſſity of a good Life, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroy or ſuperſede all Religion.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that moſt common and moſt fatal abuſe of it, for I am confident there are more Souls periſh by that, than by any other miſtake whatſoever, and a thouſand times more than by down-right Infidelity and Disbelief of all Religion, which is a very rare thing and 'tis hard to find out any certain inſtances that have ever been of it in the World 'tis ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Natural Senſe and Reaſon, and Apprehenſion of Mankind, but the other is the commoneſt thing in the World even for Chriſtians per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps above any others, to make falſe Reaſonings to themſelves from this priviledge of Repentance which we have in the higheſt degree from the Goſpel, to think they may ſecure and ſave their Souls, and yet indulge and allow themſelves in the preſent enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Sins, becauſe they may ſet all right by Repenting of them hereafter. I ſhall therefore againſt this errour and abuſe of Repentance and to

Can we think a Wiſe God would make ſuch a Grant and Conceſſion to his Creatures as ſhould deſtroy all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and make void the neceſſity of Obedience and a good Life? which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theſe Mens thoughts is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably done by this Goſpel-privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Repentance: For ſince, ſay they, a Man is as certainly ſafe who comes in at any time upon Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and ſhall be as certainly ſaved by the Terms and Conditions of the Goſpel as if he had ſpent all his Life in the ſtricteſt Vertue and Religion. What need is there of ſuch an early, and conſtant, and perpetual Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſpending a whole Life in the ſervitude and drudgery of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, when coming in at the eleventh hour, and working but a ſhort ſpace at the latter end of the day, will have as much Wages, and as ſure a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and be as certainly accepted by God? Shall not a Sinner when ever he returns and repents find Mercy? Is there any time or bounds prefix'd to his Repentance, ſo that he may not do it ſo many years hence as well as
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:103342:158"/>at preſent; and after he has taken a great deal of liberty, and had the full ſwinge of his Luſts and vicious Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, when they afterward grow calm and cool of themſelves, and he is tired or ſatiated with them, then to leave them after he has had a full and a long enjoyment of them: To Repent time enough to avoid all the bitter effects and puniſhments of them, after they have fully taſted and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted all their ſweetneſs and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs, and then throw away the poyſonous core when they have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently eaten of the dainty and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Fruit. Men to be ſure will draw ſuch conſequences to themſelves, when Religion they think puts ſuch an Argument into the hands of their Luſts which are apt to be too ſtrong of themſelves againſt all Religion and Reaſon whatſoever, and when they have ſuch a fair colour and pretence as they ſuppoſe from Religion it ſelf, they will be ſure to improve it to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all Religion by this one part of it, and by turning its own weapons upon it ſelf: So that like the Eagle in the Fable it ſhall receive its mortal wound from a dart that comes fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:103342:159"/>from its own wing, and by this ſubtle contrivance it ſhall be made to countermine it ſelf. Is Heaven then to be thus out-witted and over-reach'd in its own policy? And whereas it deſigned this priviledge of Repentance to bring Men to Vertue, ſhall the Devil find out a ſtratagem whereby to be too hard for it even upon its own ground, and make it an inſtrument to encourage Men in their Sins? Has God like a ſoft, and eaſie, and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Prince granted ſuch a Charter, and made ſuch Conceſſions to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as ſhall deſtroy his own Power and Government, and make their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience looſe and precarious? No ſure, neither his Wiſdom nor his Power is to be thus leſſened and diminiſhed; nor is the Grace of God, the greateſt favour of the Goſpel to be thus turned into wantonneſs, and a principle of looſneſs and licentiouſneſs, as theſe Men make it who thus preſume upon Sinning at preſent upon the advantage of an after Repentance, and reſolve therefore to run on in the ſcore, and to take up great ſummes in hand, and be much in debt to Heaven, becauſe they think the whole may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:103342:159"/>pounded at the laſt, and made up for a very little. We may be ſure in the general there muſt be ſome great er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and miſtake in this matter, and that 'tis either a falſe Principle that theſe Men go upon, or that they draw a very falſe Concluſion from it; for God muſt be a very eaſie Being, and Religion muſt have a very <hi>weak place</hi> in it if it lye open to ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We commonly tell Men in the ſecond place therefore to prevent this, that the after Repentance is very ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous and uncertain, for no Man knows that he ſhall have time to do it hereafter, or that he ſhall not be ſurprized with a ſudden and unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Death before he has performed this Repentance he deſigned, and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is very conſiderable; and were there nothing elſe, yet a wiſe Man would not venture his Soul and its Eternal State upon ſo great an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty as Life and Futurity is, for that we know is no more in our own power to command, than it is to recall the time that is paſt, and who that thinks and conſiders what Eternity means would hazard it upon ſo tickliſh a caſt,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:103342:160"/>and ſo perfect a lottery as the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Life is. Do not we ſee moſt of the World ſnatch'd away on a ſudden, Death hardly giving them any warning, but coming upon them with ſecret and undiſcerned ſteps, and ſtealing up to them and ſtriking the fatal blow before they were aware of it; and what ſhall this poor wretch do whoſe Life is <hi>done</hi> before his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is <hi>begun?</hi> He who intended ſo many years hence to begin his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, ſhall begin it ſooner in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, but ſhall never end it, but Repent in vain to all Eternity, in <hi>weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth</hi> for his folly and madneſs in not Repenting ſooner.</p>
               <p>But though this be a monſtrous ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, and no Man in his Wits would lye open to ſuch a danger which can never be repaired but may be eaſily prevented, yet this uncertainty of Life ſeems not a ſufficient ſecurity to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, becauſe 'tis a ſecurity only by accident, and it is in great meaſure loſt if a Man do live out the uſual pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod which many do, and which moſt hope to do; and there ought to be greater Reaſons to oblige them to a
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:103342:160"/>preſent Repentance and a conſtant O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, than the meer fears that they may dye ſooner; and it would be ſtrange if Religion ſhould depend upon ſuch an uncertainty, and a Man ſhould find a way to free himſelf from the neceſſity of it the greateſt part of his Life, if he were ſure to live long.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Therefore we ſtrengthen this commonly with another Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that is, That though a Man may have Time to Repent hereafter, yet God may not give him Grace to do it, eſpecially if he ſo provoke him by ſuch a neglect and abuſe of this Grace as quite defeats the end and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of it, and nothing can be more highly provoking and a more juſt ground for God to deny us his Spirit, than thus to abuſe and pervert this Grace of the Goſpel as to make it an encouragement not to Repent but to Sin becauſe they may Repent. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the longer the Cuſtom and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of Sin continue upon us, the more root they take, and the more difficult are they to be pluck'd up; and the Mind is in time ſo much hardened by them, that like a chronical Diſeaſe or an old Ulcer, by being ſuffered to run
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:103342:161"/>long upon it, they grow almoſt incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: And he muſt be in a fad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition who lets the power of his Sins thus grow upon him, and yet who finds them ſo difficult at preſent to be overcome, and who has that power dayly leſſened if not loſt whereby he ſhould do it. But ſtill though Gods <hi>Spirit ſhall not alwayes ſtrive with man. Gen.</hi> 5.3. yet we cannot poſitively determine to what degrees of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs a Man muſt arrive before God will wholly withdraw his Spirit from him; nor can we ſay that God denyes neceſſary Grace to any whereby they may Repent ſo long as they are in this ſtate of Tryal and Probation, or that there are any ſuch, though the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of Sinners, who are debarred or excluded from the power and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Repentance, for this would tend to diſcourage a great many from Repentance, and do as much harm by ſhutting thoſe out of all hopes, as by opening the gate too wide to others, or letting it alwayes ſtand open to any that will come in at any time.</p>
               <p>There muſt be therefore ſome other Conſiderations to take off the force of this miſtake, and to preſerve the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:103342:161"/>neceſſity of a good Life and a conſtant Obedience, which I ſhall endeavour to find out and offer.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Then, Such a Repentance as the Goſpel makes the condition of Pardon and Salvation, is nothing leſs than a conſtant Obedience and an entire and univerſal Goodneſs of Life, at leaſt after a wicked one, or after great fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lures and miſcarriages; for Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance as I have often ſaid, is to the Soul like a recovery of Health to the Body after ſome great Sickneſs or Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The whole Body, or the part ill affected muſt be made perfectly well and reſtored to its former ſtrength and ſoundneſs, or elſe it cannot be ſaid to be recovered. The Diſeaſe muſt be throughly got off, the ſickly matter muſt be diſcharged, the illneſs muſt be cured and removed, and the Patient muſt get his former ſtrength, and be able to perform the proper and vital operations, or elſe we cannot ſay he is well. So a Sinner muſt wholly get rid of his paſt Sins, muſt purge them all out by Sorrow and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt have his Mind wholly freed from them, and himſelf brought to
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:103342:162"/>ſuch a Spiritual ſtrength and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as to perform the Duties and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the new Life, or elſe he is not recovered by Repentance, nor brought from a bad ſtate to a good one. He may be under a method of Cure indeed, as a ſick Man is under a courſe of Phyſick, whilſt he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Sorrow for Sin, and Contrition, and Compunction, and the like, which are good means and inſtruments, and beginnings of Repentance, and ſo are miſtaken for the thing it ſelf; but his Repentance is not finiſh'd, nor is the great work perfect and compleat, till from a bad Man in any kind he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a good one, till this is done, which God knows is not, the moſt eaſie nor the moſt ſpeedy thing in the World, but requires long time, and great care, and pains, and labour, there is no title that I know of to Pardon by the Terms of the Goſpel, nor is there any true Goſpel Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſuch as we can give any warrant or aſſurance of remiſſion to by the Covenant of Grace, or the known and ordinary Rules of Gods Mercy. Were Repentance only a ſudden Paſſion, or a tranſient Act of the Mind, were it
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:103342:162"/>only an inward Sorrow Trouble and Compunction of Heart, it might be quickly performed, and no Sinner would be without it; but <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> might be ſaid to Repent thus far and after this faſhion, for thus the <hi>one repented and ſaid, I have ſinned, Mat.</hi> 27.3, 4. the ſecond <hi>was exceeding ſorry for what he had done, Matth.</hi> 6.26. and the other was ſo ſenſible of his Sin that he cryed out, <hi>My puniſhment is greater than I can bear, Gen.</hi> 4.13. But true Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is only known and made to be ſo by an habitual and laſting change both of Mind and Life, by an actual a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment and reformation, by a turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away from all our evil deeds and all our wickedneſs whatſoever that we have committed, and doing that which is lawful and right, which is the cleareſt and fulleſt Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion that gives us the true Nature of Repentance which includes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and actual Obedience, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes theſe fooliſh and wicked re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves of ſecuring our ſelves by play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an after-game of Repentance. They who deſign this have no ſenſe of the true worth and excellency of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:103342:163"/>but are only for making uſe of it for a little turn at the laſt, as Goal-birds learn to read meerly for the ſake of their Neck-verſe; for though they like their Sins much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and would alwayes live in them it is plain if they were left to their choice, yet they at laſt unwillingly bring themſelves to part with them as Men throw over their Goods in a Storm for fear they ſhould be loſt and Shipwreck'd with them: Thus miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly do they miſtake and miſunderſtand the true Nature of Repentance, which is a perfect changing the Habit and Temper, and Frame of a Mans Mind, and bringing other Thoughts and Principles and Inclinations into it, which is called in Scripture <hi>a new Heart and a new Spirit,</hi> and this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing an entire and permanent and univerſal change of the Life and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and making a Man become bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in every particular and in the whole a very good Man.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is obſervable that Repentance is all along in the Goſpel made a Duty previous and antecedent to Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and what was ſuppoſed to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Baptiſm, and what was neceſſary
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:103342:163"/>before-hand to fit and prepare Men to become Chriſtians; thus <hi>they were to repent, and be baptized, Acts</hi> 2.38. <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> who was to prepare the way for Chriſtianity, did it by preaching Repentance for this reaſon, <hi>Becauſe the Kingdom of Heaven was at hand, Matth.</hi> 3.2. <hi>i. e.</hi> Chriſtianity or the ſtate of the Goſpel, which is agreed by all to be there meant by <hi>the kingdom of Heaven</hi> was now approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and our Bleſſed Saviour upon that Principle and Argument preach'd the ſame Duty, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>From that time he began to preach, and to ſay, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</hi> And the Diſciples of Chriſt preach'd this Duty <hi>Mark</hi> 6.12. when they were to prepare and diſpoſe Men to receive Chriſt and to embrace Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and when any that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult were received into the Church and Chriſtianity by Baptiſm, they were ſuppoſed to be Penitents before they were Chriſtians. It was a Duty and a Condition alwayes implyed and required, that they Repented of their paſt Sins, and ſincerely promiſed and reſolved upon a new courſe of Life. <hi>That they who had their converſation in
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:103342:164"/>times paſt in the luſts of the fleſh, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling the deſires of the fleſh and of the mind, and were</hi> by Nature <hi>the children of wrath,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. <hi>i. e.</hi> in the ſtate they were in before they were Chriſtians, (for the Goſpel conſiders all Mankind as in a ſtate of Sin and Guilt before they are admitted into Chriſtianity which is a ſtate of Pardon and Salvation) that theſe when they were made Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>were to put off the old man with his deeds, Col.</hi> 3.9. <hi>i. e.</hi> all the old Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits and Acts of Sin which they were guilty of in their unchriſtian ſtate, and were <hi>to put on the new man, which after God is created in righteouſneſs and true holineſs, Eph.</hi> 4.24. and they were to become <hi>new creatures in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and were therefore then ſaid to be <hi>regenerated,</hi> and to be <hi>born again,</hi> and are repreſented in Scripture, as <hi>dying unto all ſin in Baptiſm,</hi> that they ſhould <hi>not henceforth live any longer therein,</hi> Rom. 6.2. <hi>They are buried with Chriſt by baptiſm into his death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed from the dead, even ſo we alſo who are baptized into his death ſhould walk in newneſs of life, ver.</hi> 3. So that after Baptiſm we
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:103342:164"/>ſhould <hi>reckon our ſelves to be dead unto ſin, but alive unto God through Jeſus Chriſt, ver.</hi> 11. So that <hi>the body of ſin is then to be put off and deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin, ver.</hi> 6. Thus though Men were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as Sinners before their Baptiſm, yet they were looked upon ever after as <hi>Saints</hi> in the Scripture phraſe and account, and were ſuppoſed to have repented and renounced all their Sins before they were admitted into Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and that as a previous and antecedent Condition neceſſary to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie and prepare them for it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was uſually ſome time of tryal and probation appointed by the Primitive Church, to ſee whether thoſe Candidates of Baptiſm were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere or no in their Promiſes and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and if afterwards they broke and violated thoſe, and committed any great and notorious Sin which they had renounced in their Baptiſm, and was contrary to their Baptiſmal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, they turned them out of the Church for it, and excluded them from the Benefits and Priviledges of Chriſtianity; ſo that they accounted not thoſe for true Chriſtians who were
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:103342:165"/>Penitents, and who ſtood in need of Repentance for any great Sin: And indeed he is not a Chriſtian who does ſo, he is fallen off from Chriſtianity, and has quitted and renounced his Baptiſmal Vow, and has forfeited the rights of it, and has put himſelf out of the Chriſtian ſtate and the ſtate of Grace, who is guilty of any Mortal Sin, and who is in a ſtate of Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for it. Penitence was therefore alwayes accounted by thoſe firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians a very terrible and dreadful thing, if we read of the cryes and tears, and diſcipline and behaviour of the antient Penitents, though the looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and irreligion of latter times has made it to be thought a ſlight, and eaſie, and trivial matter, but it is plain from Scripture that it was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as previous and antecedent to Chriſtianity and from the Primitive Church that it cut Men off and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded them out of it, and that ſo far in the opinion of ſome as never to be again admitted into it. The Antient Church at firſt accounted him ſo far from being a Chriſtian, who was in the ſad and wretched ſtate of Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for any great and Mortal Sin,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:103342:165"/>that it thought he deſerved never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to be received into the Church, nor admitted into Chriſtian Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, no not <hi>in articulo mortis;</hi> It was ſo horrid a reflection in its eſteem up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſtianity, ſuch a diſgrace to the Goſpel of Chriſt, and ſo unworthy the Chriſtian Profeſſion to have a Chriſtian guilty of any ſuch great Sin as Murder, Adultery, or the like, that it would never own him again that was ſo, nor receive him as a Chriſtian. But,</p>
               <p n="6">6. Though Chriſtianity be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent ſtate of Pardon and Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo that this is by no means to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to Sins after Baptiſm, according to the <hi>Novatian</hi> Hereſie which ſprang out of that firſt ſevere Diſcipline of the Church, and which it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards forced to condemn, yet 'tis a thing ſtrange, and unknown, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to Chriſtianity, that Men ſhould go on in a courſe of renewing their Sins, and ſo renewing their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for them as often as they think fit. This would be making Chriſtianity run in the Popiſh Circle of Sin and Repent, Repent and Sin, and ſo dance round without any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:103342:166"/>provided we ſtop at the laſt at the right point. I am far from that ſevere Principle charged upon <hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> of old, and <hi>Smalcius</hi> of late, which allowes not Repentance to any great and voluntary Sins committed after Baptiſm, though that were given on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Adult and to thoſe of full Reaſon and Underſtanding; this would be the moſt uncomfortable thing in the World to the beſt Chriſtians, few of which could ſet up to themſelves this narrow Ladder, and ſo go alone to Heaven by it, as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ſaid to one of the Patrons of this Doctrine. And I think the inſtance of the Ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous <hi>Corinthian,</hi> and the unworthy Communicants at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and many other places in the New Teſtament clearly confute it; and it makes the Chriſtian Covenant ſo much worſe than the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> which had ſtanding means of Expiation and Remiſſion, that it needs no more to confute it: And though Baptiſm be not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, yet the benefit of it reaches forwards as well as to what is paſt, as Chriſts Death alſo does, and we are partakers of Chriſts Blood for the remiſſion of Sins in the other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:103342:166"/>as well as this, without any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the pretended Sacrament of Penance for this purpoſe, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts argue: But though the Goſpel has given us a ſtanding Charter of Pardon upon Repentance, which is not forfeited by every new breach and violation, yet if we do not accept of it, and perform the Condition after it has been offered and tendered to us, we may juſtly be debarred and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from it, and God may when he pleaſes, without any breach of Promiſe or of Covenant, cut us off from it; for he may take away our Lives when he will, and ſo ſhorten and limit the time when this Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſhall expire and determine, and when we ſhall no further have any benefit of it. Like a Prince who ſets out a Proclamation of Pardon and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnity to all Rebels that ſhall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately come in, and return to their Allegiance, if they delay and refuſe to do this, they forfeit all their right to it, and may be ſiezed and executed when ever he thinks fit. Should a Government grant a General Pardon to all Offenders when ever they ſhall pleaſe to come in and claim it, it
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:103342:167"/>would deſtroy it ſelf, and encourage all manner of Villany and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: And if God ſhould grant this to all Sinners when they had ſtood out in rebellion againſt him all their Lives, that at the laſt moment of them they ſhould have the full and entire benefit of it, he would unavoidably encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them in their Sins, and relax and abate all the Obligation to his Laws, and unlooſe Men from the neceſſity of a good Life, which was very far to be ſure from the deſign of God in granting this Priviledge of Repentance. But 'tis an horrid abuſe of it, and a <hi>turning this Grace of God into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs,</hi> and putting a trick upon God and Religion by thus perverting it, and drawing ſuch miſchievous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences from it. I hope I have taken away the very Grounds of that fatal Miſtake, and the common and falſe Reaſonings that many make to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from it, or at leaſt ſhall do ſo before I have done, and particularly by the next Chapter.</p>

<pb n="317" facs="tcp:103342:168"/>to: But there has been a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine raiſed from hence, and not to be learnt from any other place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, never taught by Chriſt, or any of his Apoſtles, but wholly taken up, and founded upon this Inſtance of one of the Thieves upon the Croſs, which has from a matter of Hiſtory and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance been improved to Teach and Advance a new Doctrine, no where elſe to be found in the Bible; namely, That a wicked Man, when he comes to dye, may hope to be happy and go to Heaven by vertue of a ſudden Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and a ſhort Death-Bed Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, though he has ſpent his whole Life never ſo careleſly and wickedly: Or that a Death-Bed Repentance may be by the Goſpel ſufficient and effectual for a Mans Salvation, who has lived a very ill Life, and who does not ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Repent of it, than when he comes to dye. Now this I think is not only the falſeſt, but the moſt Pernicious and Miſchievous Doctrine that can be, for it plainly takes away the neceſſity of a good Life, ſince that is not neceſſary which a Man can any way hope to be ſaved without; and ſo tends to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Men to continue in their ſins,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:103342:169"/>with the hopes that they may have time enough to repent of them when they come to dye, and that there is a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if not a likely way to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at the laſt, though they live never ſo wickedly, provided they have but a little time and warning, which hardly one in five hundred but has to perform this ſudden Repentance, and are not prevented to do it by a ſudden Death, which is an accident that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens but to few; If there be nothing elſe but this accidental uncertainty to ſecure Religion, and the neceſſity of a good Life, ſo that otherwiſe a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner may at the laſt claim the full bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Pardon by the Goſpel-Covenant if he come in then by a ſhort Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, though he has ſtood out all his life in Rebellion againſt God, and may, as we commonly ſay, dye well, and make a good end, though he lived never ſo ill: If this be true, then this Goſpel-Priviledge of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance deſtroys the Goſpel it ſelf, and the main End and Deſign of it, and takes away the neceſſity of Goſpel-Holyneſs and Obedience, in order to our future Happyneſs; it removes and alters thoſe Conditions of Salvation
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:103342:169"/>which are indiſpenſibly required by the Goſpel, it abates and remits the plain terms of it, and by ſuch a clauſe of Priviledge takes away all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and force of its Commands, and all the Terror of its Threats and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, and in effect unlooſes all our Obligations to the Law of God, and to a good Life; whatever does this, and has ſuch miſchievous Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, and is ſo contrary to the firſt and plaineſt Truths in Religion, as I ſhall ſhow this is, cannot ſurely be a Goſpel-Doctrine, and therefore I am perſwaded that is not which allows Salvation to a meer Death-Bed Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance by the terms of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>The Great thing to ſupport this, is the inſtance of the Thief upon the Croſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.42, 43. though I ſhall ſhow there is no certain ground or true foundation to be had from that of any ſuch thing if we fully conſider and examine it.</p>
                  <p>As to the Parable of the Labourers in the Vineyard, <hi>Matth,</hi> 20. who came in at the Eleventh hour, and were rewarded as well as thoſe who were hired at the firſt; this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to another matter, and is ſpoken
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:103342:170"/>in favour of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who though not ſo ſoon called and taken into the Covenant, as the <hi>Jews</hi> yet ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards be called and received into it, and have as great Priviledges, and as great a Reward as the <hi>Jews</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who were Gods firſt, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar People, hired and called in long before them: So that this is foreign to the caſe of a late and ſhort Repentance of a dying Chriſtian, who was called or hired as ſoon as he was baptized, and knew Chriſtianity; and if he loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the day, and will not work at all, no not one hour, or any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable part of his Life, till Night comes, and then when 'tis too late, and he cannot work at all, only falls a crying and ſorrowing, and repenting for this his loytering and being idle, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Parable to excuſe ſuch an one, but only thoſe at the moſt, who had not the knowledge of Chriſtianity, or the means of Salvation ſooner offer'd them, but came in and worked as ſoon as they had, as ſoon as they were called and hired. The Parable taken altogether, muſt not be applyed further than this, as if it extended to all thoſe Chriſtians who come in and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:103342:170"/>only at the laſt, or even to thoſe who have one hours time in proportion to their whole lives to do a few Acts of Obedience, for it is by no means true that he who works and is Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious a ſhort and very little part of his Life, ſhall be as well rewarded, and have as full an hire and recompence of God in another World, as he who does ſo the whole; for then God would not <hi>render to men according to their works,</hi> as he hath declared he will do at the laſt judgment, for tho' <hi>he may do what he will with his own,</hi> yet his rewards and promiſes are now fixt and determined by a Covenant; and though God might bring in the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> at the latter hour, and reward them as well as the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe there was nothing to the contrary in theirs or any other Covenant, yet now <hi>as he that knows his Maſters will, and does it not, ſhall be beaten with more ſtripes,</hi> ſo he that hath well uſed Ten Talents, ſhall have a greater improvement, and greater gifts beſtowed upon him, and he ſhall have a higher reward who does more and greater Acts of Vertue in his life, than he who does leſs; for Heaven, though it be a gift is a
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:103342:171"/>reward too, and ſhall be exactly propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the degrees of it to the deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings and actions and behaviours of Men.</p>
                  <p>The main foundation then of this Doctrine of the Efficacy or Sufficiency of a Death-Bed Repentance muſt be the caſe of the Thief upon the Croſs <hi>i. e.</hi> the Hiſtory or Relation of a Man who dyed as a Malefactor and yet certainly went to Heaven, for that is the whole of it: Now I doubt not but many hundred ſuch Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors have gone to Heaven, and many Thouſand Sinners that were once bad Men, but yet had they never Repented till they came to dye, I do as verily believe that not one of them had gone thither, but to another place where Men ſhall for ever repent at the ſame rate that moſt Men do who have not done ſo before that time: To Ground and Eſtabliſh this Doctrine upon this Hiſtorical Caſe, and 'tis I believe the only Doctrine that has ſuch a foundation, we muſt examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it certainly and exactly comes up in all the Particulars and Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it to the caſe of a wicked Mans living a very ill life till he comes to
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:103342:171"/>dye, and then only repenting of it: We muſt then enquire whether it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and certainly appears from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Scripture gives us of it,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whether he were a very ill Man in the whole or general courſe of his Life?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whether we are ſure he did not Repent long before he came to dye? for if theſe two are not certainly known, nor do appear from Scripture, the caſe may be very different, and no way ſuit or anſwer the late and dying Repentance of a very wicked Man: And,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Suppoſing thoſe two, yet how can we tell whether this might not be an extraordinary caſe, and ſuch as belongs to no other Sinner whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whether it do appear from the account Scripture gives us of him, that he was a very ill Man in the whole or general courſe of his life? The reaſon of which inquiry is this, that a general habit of irreligion and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, through the whole courſe of a Mans life puts him into a more wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and dangerous, and deplorable ſtate than any particular Act of Sin,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:103342:172"/>or then any one ſin whatſoever; for that like a Leproſie ſpreads over and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts the whole Mind, lays the whole Conſcience waſte, and roots up all the Principles of Religion, and puts Men in the number of thoſe <hi>who have no fear of God before their eyes, and who live without God in the World;</hi> but a Man may not be ſo far gone, not be a Sinner of ſo high a rate, but may be an imperfectly good Man, and yet fall into a wilful ſin by the ſuddenneſs or greatneſs of the Temptation, by Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize and Inconſideration, and laxneſs of Thoughts; by a remiſsneſs in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and not being duely upon his Guard, and by the ſtruggle that is in his mind between the Fleſh and the Spirit, between this World and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which makes the one now and then get the better of the other; ſuch an one is a kind of borderer upon Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and lives between the confines of that and wickedneſs; and ſometimes he is governed and brought under the power of one, and ſometimes is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and made a prey by the other; Now though ſuch an one is not fit for the Kingdom of Heaven, till he comes wholly off from every wilful
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:103342:172"/>ſin, and is more under the power of Religion, yet he is nearer to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, and may ſooner by Repentance and becoming a good Man, fit himſelf for it, and ſo enter into it. It does not at all appear in Scripture from the Hiſtory of this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Theif whether he had been a very ill Man or no, in the general courſe of his Life; only that he was a Thief, which was enough to denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate him <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and ſuffered as he himſelf owns, <hi>juſtly, and received the due reward of his deeds, Luke</hi> 23.41. But who knows what abatements his ſin might have either by extream ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, or ſome other circumſtances which God might fairly conſider and allow for, though he was brought to an infamous Death here by the ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Humane Laws: Even a good Man who is ſo in the general courſe and habit of his Life, may fall into a particular act of wilful ſin, as we ſee in <hi>David, Moſes,</hi> and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>let him that ſtandeth take heed leſt he fall,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> adviſes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. For no Man is perfectly out of danger whilſt he is in this ſtate of probation and infirmity; and though every ſuch
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:103342:173"/>Sin breaks a Mans good State, and puts him into an ill one, till he recovers himſelf by Repentance and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for Mens States of Grace and Damnation are no way fixt here, but are alterable in this World according to the temper of their minds, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of their lives, yet 'tis more eaſie to recover from a ſingle act than a long habit, as 'tis to cure a green wound than an old Ulcer, or a Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Diſeaſe: And where there is an habitual ſoundneſs within, where the Mind is not vitiated with habitual Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and evil Principles, and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious Habits and Cuſtoms, but has a pretty good Senſe of Religion, though it happens to be over-powred with a temptation, there it will ſooner reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it ſelf, and throw off the Diſeaſe and the Corrupt Matter by its own inward Strength, and the aſſiſtance of the Divine Grace; There the inward Senſe and the Principles of Religion will unfold and expand themſelves by the power of Reſtitution, ſince though they have been preſt down and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred, yet they have not been quite broken and deſtroyed; the Religious and Vertuous Senſe will revive again
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:103342:173"/>in the Mind which was not wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, though very much Damped and Choaked and weakned; and thus they plainly ſeem to be in thus penitent Thief by his Carriage to our Saviour, which I ſhall conſider by and by, by his rebuking the other Thief who was railing at Chriſt, with that moſt ſober Reprimand, <hi>Doſt thou not fear God, ſeeing thou art in the ſame condemnation, ver.</hi> 40. and by the firm belief and full perſwaſion he had of the happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of another State, and his Devout and Religious Prayer to Chriſt to remember him when he came into his Kingdom; Theſe make it very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that he was not a very profligate or ill Man in the general courſe of his Life, but rather ſuch a good one, who lived not in the habit of many great ſins, but fell into a particular Act by a Temptation that might greatly leſſen it before God, though it made him an Example before Men: But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whatever his Sin was, however great, and however ſinful a Man he had been, yet who knows how long he had repented, and how ſincerely, and what fruits he had ſhown of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance? We know not when the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:103342:174"/>theft was committed, and whether he did not immediately Repent of it, and make Reſtitution for it, even before he was apprehended, and before the thoughts and terrours of Death frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him into it; and herein may lye a mighty difference, for if a Man upon the reflection of his Sin and a wicked Life, and the ſerious conſideration of the great danger he is in thereby, ſhall by the Grace of God, ſetting theſe things home upon his Mind, ſtrongly fixing and exciting theſe thoughts in him, ſhall be brought to good purpoſes and reſolutions of becoming better, and do ſtrengthen and make good theſe by his Actions, and thus begins to be good, and ceaſes to be wicked, not from a ſudden fright and fear of Death, but from the Convictions of Religion, from the free and full perſwaſion of his own mind, which is like to remain and continue with him, this puts him into a much better State and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and is more truely Repentance than that which ariſes in Men when they come to dye, when they have a force put upon them, which almoſt takes away the true freedom and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Wills; and therefore what
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:103342:174"/>they do then is owing wholly to that, and ceaſes generally when that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved: As to the Thief, we know not what his caſe was, and therefore 'tis meer conjecture to ſuppoſe he did not Repent till he came to dye, and 'tis the moſt groundleſs thing i'the World to apply his Caſe to that of a wicked Man, who repents not till he finds he muſt quickly dye, when ſo far as we know his was perfectly diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that he was neither a very wicked Man in the general Courſe of his Life, and as for that ſingle Act of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is recorded of him, that he might repent of it as ſoon as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it, and that might be many years before he ſuffered for it. We have no certain knowledge of any of theſe things, and therefore we can make no certain judgment by it, much leſs raiſe a Doctrine from it, which ſuppoſes thoſe two things which ſo far as we know may be both falſe; and then who would venture his Soul upon ſuch a mere uncertainty as that another Man whom he knows very little of did not repent till he came to dye, and lived very ill all the while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:103342:175"/>neither of which may be true, but if they were, yet</p>
                  <p n="3">3. How can he tell but this may be an extraordinary Caſe, and ſuch as no way belongs to him, nor to any other Sinner whatſoever? What if Chriſt to ſhow the wonderful and miraculous Power of his Croſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Salvation of Sinners, was pleaſed to give an uncommon and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary inſtance of it at that time ſuch as no other Sinner ſhould ever expect the like, unleſs Chriſt ſhould again come down, and dye upon the Croſs with him? What if God, <hi>who will have Mercy on whom he will have Mercy,</hi> was pleaſed to let this penitent Thief be a ſingular Example of his unlimited Power and Prerogative to ſave beyond all ordinary Rules, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his dying at that time with Chriſt? This does no more make it to be a ſtanding and certain meaſure of his dealing with others, than a Princes ſhowing ſome extraordinary Act of Mercy to a few Perſons when he comes firſt to his Crown, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſing all Priſoners at his Inaugura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, declares that this ſhall be the conſtant Rule of his Government, or
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:103342:175"/>that his Subjects ſhall have reaſon to expect this at other times from him. Thus the Caſe might be extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as to God, but I rather lay it as ſuch upon the account of the Perſon himſelf; for 'tis certain he was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Perſon who had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour not only to dye with Chriſt, and to bear him company upon the Croſs, but to confeſs and own him there in the face of all his enemies who were then flouting and reviling him, when this good Man was owning him to be the Meſſiah, calling him <hi>Lord,</hi> and praying him <hi>to remember him when he came into his Kingdom.</hi> So that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the moſt illuſtrious Act of Faith in him that could be, greater than his own Diſciples then had, for they did not ſo clearly believe and underſtand his Kingdom not to be of this World, and they all forſook him and fled, when this Man alone bore witneſs to him before the ſcoffing <hi>Jews</hi> and all his barbarous Crucifiers, which was being a Martyr to him, though not for him, a confeſſing him in his Death though not by it. And he that did thus <hi>confeſs Chriſt before men,</hi> and was not aſhamed to do it when he
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:103342:176"/>was in his loweſt and moſt contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible ſtate, and who probably was for this treated with more inſulting mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery if not worſer uſage by Chriſt and his own Crucifiers, is it any wonder that Chriſt according to his Promiſe <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.32. ſhould <hi>confeſs ſuch an one before his Father in Heaven?</hi> And that <hi>he who ſuffered with him,</hi> and ſo eminently believed in him, <hi>ſhould reign with him,</hi> and be ſaved and received into his Kingdom? Can a wicked and careleſs Sinner who has denyed Chriſt by his Life, who has affronted, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed and contemned him, who in the language of Scripture <hi>has crucified to himſelf the Son of God afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame, Heb.</hi> 6.6. by Apoſtatizing from his Baptiſm and by an unchriſtian Life, can ſuch an one expect to have the ſame treatment and uſage from our Saviour for a few dying Sorrows, and empty Vows, and little Remorſes as this Famous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, this Great Confeſſor, this Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Martyr, this Apoſtle of Chriſt, as I may call him, who preached him upon the Croſs before his greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and ſealed his Illuſtrious Faith in him with his dying words and his
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:103342:176"/>laſt breath? No ſurely, the caſe muſt be very different between him and an ordinary and profligate Sinner, a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and vile Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>I do not think any far fetched No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion neceſſary to ſalve this matter of the Thieves Salvation, by ſuppoſing him with a late Author, to have the benefit of Baptiſm, the <hi>Baptiſmus San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinis,</hi> and then that Baptiſm will ſave a Man without Obedience and a good Life. For I deny that Baptiſm has any ſuch Grace or Benefit, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoſe to ſave a wicked Man, tho' he ſhould be Baptized <hi>in articulo Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> when he was juſt a dying: For if a newly Baptized Perſon be not actually a good Man in ſuch a degree as God will accept by the Terms of the Goſpel, his Baptiſm ſhall not ſave him, though it puts him into a ſtate of Salvation if he be ſo, but not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as is plain by <hi>Simon Magus;</hi> for the conditions of Salvation are not ſpecifically different before Baptiſm and after, but only gradually: If they were, a Man would defer his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm till near his Death as ſome did of old upon this miſtaken Notion of ſuch a Baptiſmal Grace as ſaves a Man
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:103342:177"/>by an outward without an inward Regeneration and real Holineſs, the actual proof and ſigns of which the Primitive Church required in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult before they admitted them to Baptiſm. And therefore to ſuppoſe a Man may be ſaved upon Baptiſm, though he is not a good Man, is not allowable, but if he dye juſt upon it, God will judge him according to the preſent temper of his Mind, and the paſt courſe of his Actions, allowing him the Gracious Termes of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel which he has now a right to by his Baptiſm; but to think he can be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without any Actual Goodneſs in his Mind and in his Life, is I think very falſe; though a leſs degree may ſave him that knows not Baptiſm or Chriſtianity than him that does. But as for the Baptiſm of Blood, or allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Martyrdom the priviledge of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, this is not founded upon ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary right but preſumptive equity, and Salvation is allowed to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no Man but muſt be preſumed to be a very good Man, and have a high degree of actual Vertue and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs who dyes a Martyr, and prefers Religion before every thing in this
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:103342:177"/>World, even his very Life: And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this in ſome higher meaſure than meer Purpoſes and Reſolutions, and meer Sorrow and Repentance for not having it, I deny that any Baptiſm, or any thing elſe will ſave a Man.</p>
                  <p>This I ſay to prevent an Objection that it would not otherwiſe be eaſie to Anſwer, which is this, That if the Grace of Baptiſm will ſend a wicked and unqualified Soul to Heaven by vertue of a meer dying Repentance, without any degrees of Actual Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>without which,</hi> the Scripture tells us, <hi>no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> why may not the Grace of the Euchariſt do the ſame by the like dying Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? Or according to the <hi>Roman</hi> Principles, the Grace of Penance and Abſolution, or of Extreme Unction, which have all the ſame ſuperſtitious Error at the bottom.</p>

<pb n="338" facs="tcp:103342:179"/>for all that a Man can then do, does not come up to true Repentance, ſuch a Repentance as has Pardon and Salvation promiſed to it by the Terms of the Goſpel. A Man may then be very ſorry for his Sins, and heartily troubled and concerned for them, but this Sorrow alone, were it upon never ſo good Reaſons, is not Repentance, but that which may bring us to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>Godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row worketh Repentance,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. and therefore it is not the thing it ſelf. We may as well ſuppoſe that feeling the ſmart of a Wound is healing it, as meer Sorrow for Sin is true Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Few Sinners and few Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors but are thus ſorrowful when they come near the place of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Execution: They are ſorry they muſt ſuffer for their Sins, and the terrour of their Sufferings makes Sin very bitter to them, but if that were removed, they would love them and commit them perhaps as much as ever. If Sorrow alone for Sin though never ſo deep and grievous were true Repentance, then <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> were as great Penitents as any, and ſo will all the damned be to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:103342:179"/>who will thus ſorrow and thus repent for ever of their Sins, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any amendment; and they will wiſh alſo a thouſand times that they had been wiſer, and lived better, and had not by their fooliſh and wicked courſes brought themſelves into ſuch a miſerable and wretched condition, and would God but let them live over their Lives again, oh how much better would they be! how much otherwiſe would they live! and how heartily would they purpoſe and reſolve to leave all their Sins and lead a very good Life, would God but give them opportunity and ſpace, and try them once more! This is the language of Sinners both in this World and the next too, when the day of Grace and the time of Tryal is over, when it is too late to do all this which they now wiſh they had done, but would not do it when God gave them time, and ſo they have loſt the only opportunity which it is impoſſible to retrieve. Would God grant either the Sinner that is damned or the Sinner that is a dying opportunity to live again, they would both be better perhaps, but ſince he does not, he will judge them
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:103342:180"/>not according to what they would be but what they have been, not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what they wiſh and reſolve to do but what they actually have done, ſince the Scripture no where tells us that Men ſhall receive according to their Wiſhes, their Purpoſes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, but according to their Works and Actions, <hi>whether they have been good or evil.</hi> And therefore,</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2ly,</hi> I believe there is no ground for that determination which has been often given about a Death-Bed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: n: that if a Mans Purpoſes are then ſo ſincere that he would make them good if he lived, that then they may be ſufficient to his Salvation. Had God given him time to make them good, and from a bad Man to have become a good one, which is the only true Notion I know of Repentance, then indeed he had fallen under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and the meaſures of the Goſpel, where God has declared Pardon to all Men that Repent and Amend, but no where that I know of to thoſe who only reſolve to do ſo, though never ſo ſincerely And therefore ſhould a Mans Purpoſes be never ſo ſincere at
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:103342:180"/>that time, which I doubt not but they may be as to the preſent ſenſe of his Mind, that is, he may really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend at that time what otherwiſe could not be properly called a Purpoſe or Reſolution in him, yet this may not be afterwards effectual, but may go off as moſt of the Vows of Sick Men and Ship-wrecked Mariners do when the Sickneſs and the Storm is over, and they are juſt as they were before when they are well and upon dry Land; for nothing is more eaſie and more ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den than to wiſh and purpoſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve well, eſpecially when Men are under any great fear or great danger which wholly takes up their Minds, and they conſider not ſo much the difficulty of performing what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve upon, as the neceſſity they ſee of avoiding the danger that is before them; but when they are got free from that, their Minds and their Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes change as well as their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. But let us allow all that can be ſuppoſed that theſe Purpoſes of the dying Sinner are not only ſincere but would be effectual too, if he lived, which neither he nor any other but only God can know, yet I ſee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:103342:181"/>to think that God will deal with him for what he might or would here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be, and not for what he was or is at preſent, or that the Rule of the Divine Judgment at the laſt day ſhall be this, to reward Sinners becauſe they might have been good Men if they had lived longer, or to puniſh good Men becauſe they might have been bad perhaps if they had lived longer too, though God had ſeen either of theſe in his Infinite Preſcience, but thinks fit to prevent them by cutting a Man off and taking him out of the World, he will not acquit or condemn him for foreſeen futurities which might or would have happened, but for paſt and certain Actions which he hath done, and which God himſelf cannot make to be undone, though he may hinder theſe to be done which are not, and ſo to become nothing. 'Tis the preſent Habit and Temper and Frame of a Mans Mind, and the preſent Moral ſtate of Vertue or Vice which a Man is in when he dyes ſhall diſpoſe him to Happineſs or Miſery; ſo that 'tis not he that was formerly or might hereafter be a good Man if he had lived, but only he that is ſo at preſent
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:103342:181"/>in the diſpoſition of his Mind and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of his Life, is fit for the Kingdom of Heaven, and <hi>meet for the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Saints in light:</hi> And 'tis not he that was a wicked Man here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, or might be ſuch afterwards if he had lived in ſuch tryals and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which it pleaſed God to take him away from, and ſo in this ſenſe <hi>take him from the evil to come,</hi> but he that is a wicked Man at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the habit of his Mind and courſe of his Life ſhall go to Hell. Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is not a reſolution to forſake Sin and become a good Man, but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſo after we have been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in any inſtance. And he that has lived very careleſly and wickedly all his life, and only reſolves to live other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe when he comes to dye, can no more be called a good Man than he a good Schollar that has ſpent all his time idly in the Univerſity, but when he is to be expelled from thence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to ſtudy hard: Or he a Rich Man who has prodigally waſted all his Eſtate, but when it is gone almoſt to the laſt Farthing reſolves to ſave and become Rich. Good reſolutions are good ſpurs to quicken, and are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:103342:182"/>to carry on and put us upon any great or excellent deſign, but if the deſign were attained as ſoon as it is purpoſed and reſolved upon, no Man would miſs of his end, nor ever fail of being Wiſe and Learned, and rich and Great, if a ſudden reſolution of being ſo would do the buſineſs. Nor would any Sinner be either miſerable or wicked when he comes to dye, if it were ſufficient to purpoſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve at that time to become good and happy. 'Tis a looſe and a falſe Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Repentance which places it in meer Purpoſes, and in good Wiſhes and Reſolutions, and in a ſhort tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient paſſion and compunction of mind and inward working of thoughts, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than in a ſettled and permanent change both of Mind and Actions, in a new Heart and a new Life, in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Sin, and doing that which is lawful and right, in being renewed in our minds, and amending and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming our wayes in which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture places it, that has given occaſion to this dangerous miſtake of the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of a Death-Bed Repentance; but Repentance, as I have all along ſhowed, is a greater thing than moſt
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:103342:182"/>imagine. 'Tis not a ſlight Remedy, but a Medicine made up indeed of a great many parts and ingredients, ſuch as Sorrow and Trouble, and Faſting and Confeſſion, and good purpoſing and reſolving, and the like, but till theſe work the Cure, and make the Mind better, purge out all the ſickly matter, free the Soul from all its Sins and reſtore it to a ſtate of Vertue and Religion, of Grace and Goodneſs, they all ſignifie nothing; for true and perfect Repentance muſt be like Health or a recovery after Sickneſs, and till the Mind is brought off from its ſick and weak ſtate, from all its Spiritual Maladies and Sinful Habits, to a good degree of ſoundneſs, and a Vertuous Craſis and Conſtitution, ſo as to be free from Sin, work Righteouſneſs, and perform the proper acts of the Divine Life, ſo as the drunkard is made ſober, the unclean chaſt, the unrighteous not only juſt but charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the profane and irreligious devout and pious, and the like, it has not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented as the Scripture requires, nor is it qualified for Pardon or for future Happineſs; for no wicked Man in any kind ſhall enter into Heaven, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
                     <pb n="346" facs="tcp:103342:183"/>6.9. till he be made good after he has been otherwiſe in any inſtance; for one wilful and habitual Sin conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in will certainly damn him, and nothing but Obedience, which if it be after Diſobedience is called Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, is the Goſpel Condition of our Salvation, and without this, faith and truſt in Chriſt, and hopes in Gods Mercy and Free Grace, which are the true ſupports and comforts to a good Man, are deceitful comforts and meer deluſions to a bad one, for <hi>without ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> and habits of Grace and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> and <hi>if we will enter into life, we muſt keep the Commandments.</hi> And God ſurely did not give us ſuch Commands that we ſhould either keep them while we live, or elſe Repent of not doing it when we come to dye; then a Man might break them all while he lives, and only Repent that he had not kept them when he is a dying, and this ſhould be inſtead of keeping of them, which would defeat and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all the Goſpel, and all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Obedience and a Holy Life, and keeping Gods Commandments,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:103342:183"/>and God muſt then alter thoſe Terms, and alter even his own Judgment at the Laſt Day, and not judge us by our Works, nor by what we have done in the fleſh whether it be good or evil, but only by the ſincerity of our dying Repentance which I no where find mentioned, nor is this diſ-junctive any where in the Goſpel, Leave thy ſins and live well, and keep my Commands, or elſe Repent and be ſorry for not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all theſe things at the laſt, and that ſhall be as well. But I ſhall by and by give my poſitive Arguments more fully againſt this miſchievous miſtake.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3ly,</hi> The next difficulty, and the next plea for a Death-Bed Repentance is this, That God may on a ſudden ſo powerfully alter a Mans Mind, and ſo work upon his Heart by his Spirit, as to change and convert him, and make him another Man in a very little time, or juſt before he dyes. I anſwer, God may do this if he pleaſes to exert his utmoſt force and power upon us, and ſo he may raiſe us again after we are dead, and make us live a new Life upon Earth, but we are not I ſuppoſe ordinarily to expect this, no more are we the other, which is as contrary to
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:103342:184"/>the ordinary Methods of his Grace, as the other of his Providence; God does not uſe a miraculous and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power in either, and for any Man to depend upon this, is a downright tempting of God, and by neglecting the common means which he has put into his hands, to call for a Miracle which God will not grant to the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and idle when there is no need of it. God has given us all ſufficient Means, ſufficient Motives, and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſufficient Grace and Aſſiſtance to Repent and leave our Sins; and if we will not make uſe of theſe, but abuſe the Talents he has committed to us, he will not for that reaſon give us a double number, when we come to dye, and diſpenſe the more to us for our having been idle and prodigal all our lives. The habits of ſin and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which we have been contracting all our Lives will not be changed on a ſudden when we come to dye, when we have complained ſo long and often of our ſins, as being ſo hard to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and ſo impoſſible to be left off, ſhall we expect all of a ſudden to have it become ſo eaſie a matter, and ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den a buſineſs to get rid of them? when
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:103342:184"/>we have ſuffered them to run ſo long upon us, and have not thought 'em curable by all the Methods of Grace and Religion, ſhall we think to meet with a ſudden Charme and Amulet for them that ſhall cure them we know not how? Some Men talk of infuſed habits without being able to reconcile them either to Senſe or to Nature, and of inſtantaneous Converſion, without being able to give any one example of any ſuch thing from all the Scripture; ſome indeed were ſuddenly and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly converted to Chriſtianity, as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Goaler; and a Man may be brought to believe otherwiſe than he did by ſuch a ſtrong Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as a Revelation, which ſhall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately turn his Judgment and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, but to have him that has been along while accuſtomed to do evil, in an inſtant do good, is without preſident in Scripture, and no way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable with that known place of <hi>Jerem.</hi> 13.23. A Man cannot ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtep out of the wayes of Vice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe of Vertue; they do not lye near, but contrary to one another; ſo that a Man muſt go back and undo his vitious habits, and unravel all his
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:103342:185"/>ſinful cuſtoms by degrees before he can attain to the contrary Vertuous ones, which are not to be acquired without great pains and time, and long care and watchfulneſs. To root out Vice and make Grace grow in the heart, is not an eaſie nor a ſudden work, we find how much it coſts us to mortifie a luſt, to conquer a paſſion, to maſter an ill inclination, and what pains we muſt take with our ſelves to do this, and can we think all this may be done on a ſudden, by a Man who has all his days lived looſely, and given the reins to all theſe; that he can be made that in a moment which he could not be made all his Life? God may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed give him a New Soul, and that a very Vertuous one, and Annihilate his Old one that was ſo habitually vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, but to make that good in a moment is more difficult than the other, more contrary to Nature, and what is as little to be expected ſo far as I know from God. The ſumme is, none but a good Man can go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and none can be made ſuch on a ſudden without a Miracle; and no Man can expect to be ſaved by that, but by the ordinary Means and Grace
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:103342:185"/>of the Goſpel. Thoſe Graces and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous habits which can alone qualifie and make us meet for Heaven, cannot be brought into our Souls on a ſudden, nor can any ſudden Convictions, or ſudden Thoughts and ſudden Paſſions change and alter a Mans mind ſo as to renew it, and put it in another frame, and make it inwardly Holy and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous when it was habitually bad be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, without ſo much time, and ſo many Acts of Obedience as ſhall change its Principles, Thoughts, Inclinations, Affections, Temper, Diſpoſition, and the like. In vain had God commanded us ſo many Vertues, and ſo many Acts of Obedience as Qualifications and Conditions to fit our Minds for Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happyneſs, if without living in thoſe, and performing them any time our Souls might be diſpoſed and fitted for it. There cannot be a ſufficient change of the Mind for this purpoſe without change of Life and Actions. To talk of inward Principles of Grace in the heart without vital Acts of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſs and Obedience in the Life, and that an old Sinner by ſuch a new Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple infuſed into him, is a kind of Embrio Saint, juſt conceived, though
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:103342:186"/>not formed as he ſhould be, nor able to performe any Acts of Obedience, is to ſtrain a Metaphor, and depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Similitude without rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the thing; Every Chriſtian hath this inward Principle of Grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into him by vertue of his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme and Chriſtianity, and it exerts it ſelf with his own will and endeavours all his Life, unleſs hindred by him; and it is never perfectly taken away from any perhaps, or at leaſt only from the moſt Vile and Profligate of Sinners in this World, but it will and doth ſtir and move, even in very wicked Minds, but this is all ineffectual, and to no purpoſe, unleſs it produce Acts of Vertue and Obedience and a Good Life, without which it neither Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies nor Regenerates, nor makes us good Men, nor fit for Heaven, and without thoſe which are the Vital Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Effectual Operations of this Grace of the Goſpel which is given us by our Baptiſme, he who may be ſuppoſed to have this inward Principle infuſed into him, and ſtirring with his fears at the time of his Death, yet for all that is but an Abortive Chriſtian,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:103342:186"/>and hath neither the new Birth or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, nor the Divine Life in him.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>4ly.</hi> The great Prejudice againſt this Doctrine is this, that 'tis too ſevere, and will tend to make us judge over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hardly of others, and to throw dying Sinners into deſpair, as being in an hopeleſs State by the Goſpel, and ſo hinder their Repentance at that time as being inſufficient, and ineffectual. To which I anſwer, That 'tis no more ſevere than the Goſpel is, which ſhuts every wilful Sinner out of Heaven, and pronounces Damnation upon every one that does not live a good Life, at leaſt after a bad one, which is the true Notion of Repentance, but we muſt make a new Goſpel if we abate of this and come lower than is any way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Divine Wiſdom and Government, and with ſecuring Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Religion, and not opening a wide door to Looſeneſs and Licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and encouraging Men in their Sins rather than bringing them off from them; I believe indeed 'tis more out of pity and tenderneſs than any good ground in Reaſon or Scripture that the other Doctrine has took place, but we muſt not pervert the Goſpel
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:103342:187"/>out of an unreaſonable tenderneſs, and by pretending to be more merciful than God is or has declared himſelf to be; and 'tis I doubt the greateſt cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to our own and others Souls thus to deceive 'em into ruine by giving them hopes contrary to the Goſpel, and I account it the greateſt charity to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warne Men of their danger, and to free them from ſuch a fatal miſtake; It does not ſo much concern us to judge other Men, and apply this Doctrine to them as to our ſelves, God is their proper judge to whom we ought to leave them, and to their own Maſter they ſhall ſtand or fall at the great day, but 'tis more dangerous to aſſume a ſort of Power to diſpenſe with the Laws of God by our pretended Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to give a relaxation to the rules of the Goſpel, and the conditions of Salvation out of undue Piety, and in effect to blame and condemne God, and think he deals more hardly with Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners than he ought to do, or then we our ſelves would do, when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces Damnation upon them for their bad Lives, and will not ſave them for their dying Repentance; out of this Principle of pity others have gone
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:103342:187"/>farther, and denyed the Eternity of Helliſh Torments, and have thought it too hard that God ſhould puniſh the ſins of a ſhort Life with never-ending pains, and have therefore thought good in their great pity to releaſe all the Damned, and even the Devils themſelves out of Hell within ſo many years, but this is to underſtand the Meaſures and Reaſons of the Divine Government better than God himſelf, to preſcribe new ones to him contrary to what he has lay'd down, to ſet up a Court of Equity upon him in our thoughts, and to correct the fixt Rules and declared Meaſures of his Juſtice and Mercy with ſome others of our own, which ſurely is not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>
                  <p>As to the driving Sinners into deſpair by this Doctrine; this cannot be ſaid of thoſe who have time before 'em to repent and live better if they make uſe of it, and nothing will more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excite them, and more immediately put them upon this than the faithful and open telling them the truth as I have done, and taking them off from all hopes and truſt of a dying Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which has deſtroyed ſo many
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:103342:188"/>Souls. As for the dying Sinner him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, however I pity him, I dare not give him hopes farther than I have warrant from God and Authority from the Goſpel, which no Miniſter can have to aſſure him of Pardon and Salvation from a mere late and Death-Bed Repentance. He can only adviſe ſuch an one to do all he can at that time, which may help, if not wholly to remit his puniſhment yet in ſome meaſure, to abate and mitigate it, which is a very great thing, and commend him to the Extraordinary and Uncovenanted Mercy of God, which is not limited by any thing but the recitude of his own Nature, to which we muſt leave ſome great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes not knowing what to judge of them our ſelves, but as to the ordinary and covenanted Mercy of God which he himſelf has limited, and which ought not be ſtretcht or extended any more than narrowed or confined to any other bounds than thoſe of the Goſpel, ſuch a Repentance has no title to it by any promiſe there that I know of, and therefore I would not for all the world venture my Soul upon it, nor would have any Man elſe to do ſo; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:103342:188"/>all other hazards of a ſudden Death and the like that attend ſuch a Repentance, 'tis venturing whether God will not break the Rules and Meaſures of the Goſpel, or at leaſt abate them, and be more merciful than he has there promiſed to be, which no Man has any reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect he ſhould be, but rather a great deal to queſtion whether he can be.</p>
                  <p>Let none of us therefore truſt to ſuch a Late and Death-Bed Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which will expoſe us not only to infinite danger, but to inevitable and certain ruine, nor let us believe any ſuch Doctrine which has no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation either from the Thief on the Croſs, or from any thing elſe in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be relyed on, but however ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere the other Doctrine be, let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it is true as I ſhall fully prove it is, and I know no Miſchief of its ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry but this which is the plain conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it, that we muſt not delay our Repentance, but take care to live a good life if we hope to go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>

                  <p>HAving Examined and Anſwered the Pleas and Pretences on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of a Death-Bed Repentance I ſhall ſhow its Invalidity and Inſufficiency by ſuch plain and poſitive Proofs as ſhall take away that common error and fatal miſtake on the other ſide and fully confirm and eſtabliſh my Opinion againſt it, The firſt whereof ſhall be that Excellent Parable of the Wiſe and Fooliſh Virgins, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. eſpecially the latter part of it at the 10, 11, 12. <hi>verſes,</hi> for I ſhall not repreſent it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire in all the parts but only what is more full and home to my purpoſe in relation to the fooliſh Virgins of whom it is ſaid, That <hi>while they went to buy the bridegroom came, and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was ſhut, afterwards came alſo the other Virgins, ſaying, Lord, Lord,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:103342:190"/>open to us, but he anſwered and ſaid ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I know you not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Parables were an <hi>Eaſtern</hi> and <hi>Jewiſh</hi> way of inſtruction very frequently uſed by their wiſemen, and ſo made cuſtomary to the people, for all forms and modes and habits of ſpeech like thoſe of cloths would look odd and antick and uncouth that were not ſo; as they were very antient and very common among them and from thence taken up by our Saviour, ſo they were very agreeable to Nature, and a moſt uſeful lively and familiar way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting any Truth or Doctrine by way of Hiſtory and Similitude; They ſhewed us the thing in an Image and Picture, ſo that we ſaw it as it were before us and it thereby made a ſtrong impreſſion upon both the fancy and the memory, and they ſet us a pattern and example of it by which we might the moſt eaſily comprehend, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and remember it and have it as it were in a Scene drawn before our eyes and acted before us, which are the moſt natural ways by which Mankind are to be taught moved and affected; Abſtracted naked Truths are many times too fine for their groſs thoughts
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:103342:191"/>and underſtandings, and they cannot conceive Spiritual things ſo well as when they are dreſt up in another garb, and brought down to their Senſes; Moſt of our thoughts and apprehenſions are formed by ſuch ideas and images on the brain and mind as are the draughts and models of the things themſelves, and Parables have theſe two things in them which are apt to make the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt impreſſion upon the minds of Men which are Imagery or Picture, Acting or Repreſentation by Example. Now in theſe Dramatical Compoſures and Inſtructions there is a main Plot or one chief and Principal Deſign runs through the whole, and is chiefly aimed at and carried on in all the parts and acts of it, and that is chiefly to be minded as the Scope and Aim of the Parable, the Air and Countenance and Eye as I may call it of this moral Picture, which looks upon ſuch a principal Truth, Doctrine and Inſtruction as what it intends chiefly to convey and repreſent thereby to our minds: Now the very Scope and Drift and Deſign of the Parable of the Wiſe and Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Virgins is to ſhow that we ought to be always prepared and provided
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:103342:191"/>for another World, and that there is no hopes of entring into Heaven by any thing we can do on a ſudden when the Bridegroom is juſt a coming, and when Death is juſt upon us and very near us and we are unprepared before for it: Theſe three things are plainly meant and imported and aimed at by it.</p>

                     <item>1. That we cannot enter into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven without Holy and Vertuous Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits and Diſpoſitions of Mind.</item>

                  <p n="1">1. That we cannot enter into Heaven without Holy and Vertuous Habits and Diſpoſitions of mind, Thoſe are meant by the Oyl which the Wiſe Virgins had in their Veſſels but the Fooliſh were without, and not ſenſible of the need of it till it was too late; to think that our Soul may be happy and fit for Heaven without thoſe is as fooliſh
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:103342:192"/>and inconſiderate as to think that a Lamp will burn without Oyl, without that which is to feed and conſtitute and maintain the flame; Vertue and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are the main Things in which the happyneſs and Perfection of the Mind conſiſts, the higheſt Improvement of all its faculties and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, and the foundation of all that Peace Joy Bliſs and Satisfaction which it can have in it ſelf or any thing elſe, and the only qualification to make it capable of receiving all the happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that can be communicated to it, without theſe as we are unworthy of being received into Heaven, which is the higheſt reward which God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points to thoſe who moſt faithfully ſerve and obey him, and which he will never give to ſuch vile and undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Wretches as have contemned it all their lives and not thought it worth any of their pains and endeavours, and therefore he has barred and excluded all wilful Sinners out of it of what kind ſoever, by a poſitive Decree and Declaration, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Galat.</hi> 5.19, 20. So they ſhut out themſelves by a Natural Incapacity and Unfitneſs, for Heaven is the Place and Region of
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:103342:192"/>the pureſt Vertue and the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and God-like Holineſs, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe can dwell there or be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the pleaſures and enjoyments that are to be met with in it. An old Sinner with his corrupt Habits, and depraved and vicious Inclinations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, would find nothing there to entertain him, no ſuitable objects or proper actions to delight and pleaſe him, but would be as unfit to be took from his Vices and put into Heaven, as a Swine from wallowing in the mire to be placed on a Throne. As God will not ſuffer any ſuch impurity to appraoch that holy place nor any unclean thing to enter into it, ſo it could not be ſuppoſed capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the proper and Spiritual Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of it, till it was very much changed and altered and brought off from the love of Vice to the love of God and Goodneſs, and ſo fitted to partake both of the favour of one, and the good and happineſs of the other.</p>
                  <p>'Tis certain none but good Men ſhall enter into Heaven, and partake of the Joys and Glories above, <hi>which God hath laid up for thoſe that love him,</hi>
                     <pb n="364" facs="tcp:103342:193"/>all others are both unworthy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable to enjoy them, and ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taſte of any part of them; as I ſhall ſhow by a few Conſiderations.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. From the Nature of God, which is the ſtandard and meaſure both of all Holineſs and Happineſs too, ſo that the more any Being approaches to that, the nearer it is to Happineſs, and the more contrary it is to that the more miſerable it muſt neceſſarily be. Now Holineſs and Vertue is the only thing by which we can be like God, and become partakers of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and <hi>are changed into the ſame image,</hi> and the greateſt reſemblance of his Glorious Perfection, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. and therefore 'tis the only thing that can advance us to the higheſt degrees of Happineſs. That which makes the Devils themſelves ſuch miſerable
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:103342:193"/>wretches, nay hell it ſelf ſo wretched a ſtate, is their contrariety and repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy to God and Goodneſs, their being ſo directly oppoſite to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, their not having the leaſt Ray of Divine Goodneſs and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs to dwell in that place of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the ſink and centre of all Sin and Wickedneſs. And Heaven it ſelf is therefore ſo happy ſo bliſsful a place, becauſe 'tis the Region of all Divine Vertue and Holineſs, becauſe it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances us to a God-like State and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and transforms us into the neareſt likeneſs of God himſelf, and is the fulleſt participation of him and his Perfections. All Vertue and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is an efflux or irradiation of the Divine Nature communicated to the Humane, Gods Eſſential Holineſs trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into our Nature, his Image im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed upon our Minds, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it makes us the Children of God in the Scripture language, and ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and neceſſarily beloved by him, even in ſome degree as he loves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and takes infinite complacency and delight in his own Eſſential Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and Original Holineſs. <hi>The righteous Lord loveth righteouſneſs, Pſal.</hi>
                     <pb n="366" facs="tcp:103342:194"/>11.7. from his own Righteous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and for the ſame reaſon, <hi>The wicked his Soul hateth,</hi> for he cannot love any Being ſo contrary to himſelf, and ſo repugnant to his own Righteous and Holy Nature; for we may as well ſuppoſe him to hate himſelf or to love the Devils, the moſt oppoſite to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and therefore the moſt accurſed Beings, as to love a very wicked and impure Soul which does truly partake of the Diabolical Nature and is moſt repugnant to the Divine. He cannot take ſuch an one into his ſpecial Love and Favour, and communicate any of his own Happineſs to it and admit it into Heaven, which is the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and fulleſt participation of his Love and of his Happineſs, upon the account of its unlikeneſs and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety to the Eſſential Perfections and Holineſs of the Divine Nature.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God cannot beſtow Heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any but thoſe who are Good and Vertuous, as 'tis a Gift and Reward propoſed and promiſed by him only to ſuch as are ſo. God as he is a Juſt Judge and an Impartial Diſtributer of Rewards and Puniſhments, and <hi>will render to every man</hi> at the laſt day <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:103342:194"/>to his works,</hi> he cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injury to that Character, and the plain charge and imputation of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality and Injuſtice, beſtow and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſo great a Reward as Heaven is to be upon thoſe who are wholly unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and undeſerving of it, who have lived wickedly and diſobediently all their Lives, had no regard to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Glory of God, nor doing him any ſervice in the World, nor made Heaven and Religion and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue their great end, but gratified their Vices and enjoyed their Luſts, and allowed themſelves in all the undue liberties of Senſual Pleaſures, and broken the Divine Commands, and lived in a direct and open oppoſition to God and Religion. If ſuch Men ſhall be at laſt rewarded by God as well as thoſe who have faithfully ſerved him, and ſincerely obeyed him, and made it their buſineſs to promote his Honour and promote Religion, and do all the good they could in the World, who have denyed themſelves all unlawful pleaſures and vicious gratifications, and have took great pains with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to conquer their ſenſual incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and overcome the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:103342:195"/>of this World, and to live up to the ſtrict rules and anſwer the great ends and deſigns of Religion, if the reward of Heaven and the Crown of Glory be not laid up for theſe, and they alone partakers of it, and not the other, then God will be thought at that great day <hi>when</hi> he ſays <hi>he will judge the world in righteouſneſs,</hi> not to have <hi>done right</hi> to his Creatures, nor to have had a due regard to their Actions, not to have loved and rewarded Vertue, puniſh'd and hated Vice as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and not to have dealt with Mankind according to the known mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Juſtice among themſelves, and the certain rules of diſtributing rewards and puniſhments. The whole Scripture aſſures us the contrary to this, and the reaſon of the thing makes it impoſſible to be otherwiſe, for tho' Heaven is the Gift of God infinitely beyond what is due to any of our Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, yet 'tis a Reward too, and ſhall be given in a way of Juſtice, and in ſuch a manner as is agreeable to the rules of Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Such is the Nature of this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Happineſs that none but good Men can partake of it, for none but
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:103342:195"/>they can love God and delight in him, and take any complacency and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in the enjoyment of him. The wicked whilſt he continues ſuch is an enemy to God and a hater of him, and whilſt he is ſo were he carried to Heaven, he would be only like a Traytor taken captive and brought in Chains to his Princes Court, where it would be no pleaſure to ſee him upon his Throne in all his greatneſs whom he hated, againſt whom he had been a Rebel, and from whom he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver expect any favour; and therefore the being thus brought into his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and ſeeing all his Glory would be only a greater vexation to him, and an adding to his miſery; and only more torment him as it does the Devils, to ſee and know there is ſuch a Being above them whom they can never have their friend or be reconciled to. No Man while he is wicked can have any more hopes of this than thoſe wretched Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and therefore can never have any, or be capable of any happy commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or fruition of God in Heaven. And as to the ſpiritual pleaſures and noble enjoyments there, they are no more ſuited and adapted to him than
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:103342:196"/>any other pleaſures are to one that has loſt the proper Faculties to which they ſhould be agreeable, and by which he ſhould have the perception of them, than Muſick to one that is deaf, or Light and Beauty to one that is blind, and therefore ſuch a vicious wretch cannot be imagined to be in any other condition in Heaven, were he to go thither with his ſinful Habits, than all other Animals are when they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of their proper Elements; for Heaven is no place, nor has no ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able pleaſures and entertainments but for thoſe who love God and Goodneſs, and delight in the exerciſes and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Religion.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. From the Nature of our own Minds 'tis impoſſible we can enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven or be capable of Happineſs, without Holineſs and Vertue. Our Happineſs there muſt be ſuited to thoſe Faculties and Capacities which belong to us; it muſt lye in the higheſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and improvement of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral powers of our Minds, and the moſt proper ſenſe and enjoyment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting from thence, when our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings are advanced to the higheſt knowledge eſpecially of God and
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:103342:196"/>the Divine Nature, which is that Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifick Viſion, that ſeeing of God as he is, in which the Scripture places the chiefeſt part of Heavenly Happineſs, when the Will chooſes the chiefeſt and ſupream good with the greateſt vigour and ardour, and enjoys it with the higheſt rapture and extaſie of fruition. When our Souls are thus improved with the brighteſt underſtanding of Truth, and the ſtrongeſt love and will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Good. When our Powers and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties are the moſt raiſed and perfected, the moſt enlarged and opened, and filled up with the fulleſt enjoyment of thoſe their proper Objects, then they are in the moſt happy and pleaſurable ſtate imaginable. Now nothing can do this but Religion and Wiſdom and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which are the higheſt accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and improvement of our Minds, without which we can never enjoy the true Happineſs we were made for, and to which our Minds are fitted. Vertue alone can give that, and all the Pleaſure, Peace and Joy that reſult from it, whereas Wickedneſs will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily not only corrupt and impair the Mind and ſpoil its Faculties, but diſorder and wound and corrode it,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:103342:197"/>and make it very painful and uneaſie, and a Hell and Torment to it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As none but good Men ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Heaven, ſo none can be made good on a ſudden. Thoſe Vertuous and Holy Habits and Diſpoſitions of Mind are not to be had or attained immediately, in a little time and on a ſudden hurry; as is intimated here by the Virgins wanting Oyl, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to procure or buy it in their preſent diſtreſs when the Bridegroom was a coming. We muſt be prepared and provided with thoſe things that are neceſſary for our Future Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs before Death comes and puts us on a ſudden hurry, and alarums us with its unexpected approach, or elſe we ſhall be ſadly diſappointed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided if we expect to procure or attain them then. If we think to borrow of anothers Vertues and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to help out our own defects and wants at that time, as they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> imagine ſomething like theſe fooliſh Virgins; or as others, that the Bridegroom himſelf ſhall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them in an extraordinary manner out of his ſtock, though they have no Oyl at all in their own Veſſels, no
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:103342:197"/>Righteouſneſs of their own: All theſe vain hopes and expectations of idle and careleſs and fooliſh Sinners, will then deceive and diſappoint them and make them miſerable. If Men have not attained to the Vertues and Graces of Religion nor any degrees of Holineſs and Goodneſs all their Lives, and think to acquire them now on a ſudden when they are near dying, they may as well hope that a Tree that has bore no Fruit all the Year, ſhould on a ſudden, when it is juſt to be cut down, and the Axe is laid to the root of it, ſprout and bud, and bloſſom and bring forth Fruit. This would be a ſtrange Miracle, and it muſt be as great and unaccountable to have a wicked Man on a ſudden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a good one, and bring forth the Fruits of Vertue and Repentance. All our Vertues are owing to the Grace of God, as the growth of all Plants and Trees is to the Rain, and warmth and influence of the Heavens, but to think that Gods Grace which could not work upon a Man all his Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, will now in ſuch an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner change and convert him on a ſudden as to make him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:103342:198"/>become a good Man, is to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Saint made, as <hi>Adam</hi> was in full growth and perfect flature the firſt day he lived, without paſſing through the degrees of Youth and Childhood; as God thinks not fit to make Mankind ſo now, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces them by the ordinary and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed way of his Providence, ſo he makes good Men by the ordinary me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of his Grace and influences of Religion, and the New Creature is formed by degrees, and growes into <hi>a perfect Man,</hi> and <hi>increaſes in Wiſdom</hi> and Goodneſs till it <hi>comes to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> The Spirit worketh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Mind agreably to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in a manner indiſcernable from its own proper operation, enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Underſtanding, and inclineth the will gently and kindly by the thoughts and conſiderations of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, offering them clearly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing them ſtrongly upon the Soul, and ſo in a rational way begetting right apprehenſions and affections in it, and ſo altering the temper and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Mind, and by frequent acts and repeated practices bringing a
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:103342:198"/>Man to new habits, and thus conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him from bad to good, not in an inſtant but by long <hi>ſtrivings</hi> and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual operations upon him. No very bad Man was ever made a good one on a ſudden, nor can any more be ſo by the Grace of the Goſpel, than a Child over night become a Man the next morning by the courſe of Nature and Providence, or Seed ſown in the ground ſpring up and ripen and bear Fruit in a few hours. Such Muſhroon Converts and Penitents have no good root but dye away, and wither as ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly and inſtantaneouſly as they came up with the firſt heat and tryal of a Temptation; till Religion ſhoots deeper into their Hearts and gets better root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their Souls, like the Seed that fell on ſtony ground, it is quickly gone and does not grow at all, <hi>nor bring forth fruit with patience,</hi> as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture emphatically ſpeaks, <hi>i. e.</hi> with due continuance. Good Purpoſes and Reſolutions and ſuch like good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Action muſt continue ſome time upon the Mind, and exert their power and efficacy upon it by proper acts and tryals and experiments, or elſe they are but like falſe conceptions
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:103342:199"/>that produce nothing, like Clouds without Rain, Bloſſoms without Fruit, and abortive cauſes without any effects.</p>
                  <p>A ſudden Sorrow upon a wicked Mind will no more make it good, nor bring forth the worthy fruits of Repentance, than a ſudden ſhower upon the Sands of <hi>Arabia,</hi> or Rocks of <hi>Caucaſus</hi> will make them become fertile and good ground; there muſt be long cultivation, and great labour and pains taken with ſuch barren ground before it will be a fruitful Soil, and bring forth any thing by all the ſhowers and influences of Heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. A hardened Sinner who hath lived many years in the wretched courſes and habits of Wickedneſs, muſt by long time, and great care, and many methods of Gods Grace and Goodneſs have his Heart changed, and his Life mended, and his old Vicious Habits plucked up and new Vertuous ones planted in their place, and theſe take root, and grow up, and bear Fruit in his Life, before he can become ſuch a good Man as is fitted for Heaven: Such an one can never be made ſo in a little time juſt before Death, but it muſt require at leaſt a good part of
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:103342:199"/>his Life to become ſuch, and it ſhould be indeed the buſineſs of our whole Lives to make our ſelves ſuch as ſhall be thus fit for Heaven. To think that great work can be done at the latter end when we are juſt a dying, and may be diſpatched in a very little time, all on a ſudden, is as idle and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, as for a Man that has a good dayes journey to take to lye loytering, and never mind it till the Sun is near down and night is coming upon him, and then to ſet out and think to reach it by a ſudden ſtart, or by ſome unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable wayes to fly thither, or be Magically tranſported and ſet down he knows not how at his journeys end: Or rather to make the Caſe more exactly parallel to an old Sinner, like one who hath travelled almoſt all the day in a wrong way, and ſpurred and driven on very furiouſly in his vicious courſes, and is now to turn back and begin to take the right way when the day is far ſpent, and night is at hand and juſt upon him. So is it with a Man who hath been all his Life fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his Vices, driving on in a full career of Wickedneſs, and galloping in the way to Hell and the broad road
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:103342:200"/>of Damnation, and yet thinks by a Death-Bed Repentance and a ſhort ſtop at the laſt to come to Heaven. Good God! What thoughts have ſuch Men of the great work and buſineſs of Religion, which ought to be the great work and employment of our Lives, who think to diſpatch it all in a few moments; as if God gave us not our Lives to ſpend them in his Service and to his Glory, and to work out our Salvation and fit our ſelves for Heaven, and do good, and grow in Grace, and the like great ends of Life, but we might paſs by all thoſe and wallow in our Luſts and ſpend almoſt all our days in the gratificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Vice and Wickedneſs, and in the Devils ſervice, and think it enough to put off God with a very ſmall part at the laſt, and devote our dying hours, or a ſhort time when we know we muſt live no longer to Religion and Repentance. This is to think God a very eaſie Maſter, and Religion a very eaſie work, and Heaven a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward very eaſily to be attained and come at, and that none of them are to be ſo much minded and regarded but that a little time will ſerve the
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:103342:200"/>turn, and that all may be done and taken care of at the laſt, though not quite ſo well indeed, yet upon a forced-put the whole buſineſs may be diſpatcht in a very little time ſo as to ſecure the main chance and not fail of the great end of Religion which is to ſave a Mans Soul and go to Heaven; If this can be done a ſudden, few Men will care to ſpend much time, more time than needs about it, and this very Miſtake and Opinion is the reaſon why they do not, but generally neglect and caſt off Religion, and go on i'their Sins and live careleſly and wickedly and can never he perſwaded to a ſtrictly Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and holy Life, though they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Religion and are very far from any Atheiſtical Doubts and Denyals of it, but they think to do all the great work at the laſt, ſomething that ſhall ſerve inſtead of all the reſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and be ſorrowful for their ſins, for they account this ſufficient Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and that the dying thus peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſhall be as well as if they had min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Religion all their lives and diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the great ends of it. If it will by the fixt terms and ſtanding proviſion of the Goſpel ſave their Souls and carry

<pb n="381" facs="tcp:103342:201"/>and repoſed ſome Truſt and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in him, yet all was in vain and to no purpoſe, without due qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in themſelves; His Anſwer was, <hi>I know you not,</hi> as Chriſt's will be at the laſt day to thoſe wicked Men who yet put mighty hopes in him, and truſt and rely very ſtrongly upon him for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and think they have ſome claim and pretence to his ſpecial love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and <hi>call him Lord Lord</hi> Saviour Saviour and the like; but yet if they have not <hi>done the will of his heavenly Father</hi> in their lives, done their Duty, and made themſelves fit for Heaven, he will profeſs unto them, <hi>I never knew you, depart from me ye that work iniquity. Matth.</hi> 7.22, 23.</p>
                  <p>Earneſt and importunate Prayers are very prevailing Applications to God when the thing is fit to be granted and we fit to receive it, and when God can with conſiſtency to his Wiſdom and Juſtice and other Attributes beſtow the favour we ask of him, and 'tis accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the promiſes he hath made to us ſo that we can ask in Faith, and have good reaſon to believe it ſhall not be denyed, becauſe there is no bar or juſt cauſe either in God or our ſelves
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:103342:202"/>to hinder it, then we ſhall be certainly ſure of it, and God will alwaies <hi>give to thoſe who thus ask him,</hi> but 'tis not our unreaſonable though never ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate Prayers that will make God do an unfit or unreaſonable thing, or prevail with him to break the Rules of his Wiſdom and Juſtice, or out of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and tenderneſs violate the ſtanding wiſe Methods of his Providence and Government: Pity and Compaſſion is not a weak paſſion in God as it is in Men, who are in pain to ſee another fall into ſuch a miſery as they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to themſelves, and which may as well fall upon them, and therefore they have a fellow-feeling of it, becauſe it touches them with the quick thought of their own frailty and liableneſs to it, but God is ſubject to no ſuch weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and uneaſineſs, and therefore pity in him is but a wiſe Exerciſe or Effect of his Goodneſs whereby he is inclined to inflict as little evil and do as much good to his Creatures as the Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their Nature, and the Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of his own will admit:</p>
                  <p>Should a Wiſe and Good Governour out of weak pity and commiſeration to the cryes and lamentations of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:103342:202"/>Priſoners and dying Malefactors ſtop the courſe of Juſtice and ſuſpend the Execution of wholeſom and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Laws, He would deſtroy his Government by his eaſineſs, and bring a thouſand times more Miſchief to the Publick, and ſo his Pity inſtead of a Vertue would become both imprudence and cruelty in the higheſt degree.</p>
                  <p>God as he is Pityful and Mercyful, ſo he is Wiſe and Juſt too, and will not break the ſtanding Rules of the Goſpel nor the wiſe meaſures of his Divine Government by which he impartially diſtributes Rewards and Puniſhments according to Mens Works, out of any fond conſideration to any Mans parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular caſe, He will not, he cannot act contrary to the unalterable Rules of Juſtice either in puniſhing the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, or clearing and letting the guilty go free, He muſt lay down his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World if he were merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful contrary to thoſe, and ſhould not ſo far regard his own Honour, and aſſert his Power and Authority, and Juſtifie the goodneſs of his Laws as to revenge all open affronts againſt them, and puniſh all great and notorious and habitual Sinners notwithſtanding all
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:103342:203"/>their Prayers and Entreaties to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; If the cryes and lamentations of a dying Sinner ſhould make God forgive him out of meer pity and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs though he had broke all the Laws of Heaven in his life and lived in direct oppoſition againſt them and never took any care to keep them, this muſt alter the Rule of God's Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Rule of the Goſpel, and the Rule of his laſt Judgment, and he muſt for his ſake break and act contrary to all thoſe; If notwithſtanding thoſe, Gods Pity and Mercy to a poor Wretch could ſuffer or incline him to do this, we might then as reaſonably hope that this his pity might reach even to the damned in Hell, their Caſe is very pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable and very lamentable as well as the others, and their cryes and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and lamentations are very loud and importunate, but they are unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and too late, and therefore God is deaf to them; one would think if Pity could ſo over-rule Juſtice as to prevail with it to diſpenſe with the ſevere and righteous Rules lay'd down by the great God, it would put out the flames of Hell, or let the tears and cryes of the damned quench thoſe dreadful and
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:103342:203"/>Everlaſting burnings, and not ſuffer ſo many poor and miſerable Creatures to lye tortured for ever in the utmoſt Extremity, but God's Juſtice and Judgment is as deep and bottomleſs as Hell it ſelf, and though we cannot ſearch into all the reaſons of it, yet we know by his word that it ſhall take place and be duely executed not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his own greateſt Pity and Mercy, or his Creatures greateſt Cryes and Lamentations.</p>
                  <p>A groundleſs preſumption of God's Mercy and Pity hath ruined many Souls; The Goſpel declares the higheſt inſtances and degrees of it in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the World by Jeſus Chriſt, and in pardoning our ſins up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Repentance, and to ſhow this required a wonderful Method and moſt Stupendous Expedient, thus to find out a way to reconcile Gods Juſtice and Mercy together by the Sacrifice of Chriſt, now this utmoſt Grace and Mercy of Heaven neither does nor could go farther than paſt Sins upon Repentance and Amendment Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and a good Life afterwards; to expect any Mercy from God beyond this, beyond the Goſpel and the Rules
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:103342:204"/>and meaſures of Mercy there layd down is the moſt vain and groundleſs and preſumptuous thing i'the World, and ſo 'tis for a dying unprepared Sinner to think he can do any thing then by which he may hope to prevail with Chriſt, and to enter into Heaven:</p>
                  <p>For alaſs what can he then do? He can uſe ſtrong Crying and Tears and Prayers to God, ſo did the Virgins and ſo may the Damned; but alaſs for what can he pray? That God would ſave him without Obedience and a good Life, which he has declared he never will; that he would not now puniſh him for a wicked and impenitent and diſobedient life, which he aſſuredly will do, that he may not now be ſhut out when the Bridegroom is coming, though he is no way prepared for it and has no Oyle in his Lamp, no ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous habits and Diſpoſitions of mind to fit him to go in, and now 'tis too late to get them all on a ſudden, and in vain to expect to borrow this Oyl of others, or to have it given by the Bridegroom himſelf; would he pray now to God to give him Grace when he has deſpiſed and rejected it all his Life, would he now have it grow up
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:103342:204"/>into vertuous habits and the frults of Obedience and a good life all on a ſudden, would he now become a new Man and a new Creature in a few hours, and from a wicked Man all his life become a good one in a few days: He may almoſt as well hope that God ſhould make him young again now he is old, and turn his old and weak and dying Body into a young and luſty and healthful one and work thoſe mighty Miracles upon his Body as well as his Mind by his Prayers; God can do the one by an Almighty Irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible power as well as the other if he pleaſes, but 'tis very vain and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to depend upon the utmoſt of what God's power is able to do in any thing, and therefore that is never to be brought in for or againſt any thing of this Nature.</p>
                  <p>The only queſtion is not what God, but what ſuch a wicked Man and dying Sinner can then do, can he have all his old habits of vice and wickedneſs rooted out and his Nature changed, and a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and holy diſpoſition of mind plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their ſtead? Can that luſt or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Inclination which was ſo hard to be conquered before, that he pretended it
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:103342:205"/>was impoſſible for him almoſt to leave it can this now be ſo ſoon and ſo eaſily overcome? All thoſe Corruptions and Diſeaſes of Soul which have been ſo long upon him that they are become chronical and habitual, and which were before incurable by all the means of Grace and methods of Providence, by all the advices and exhortations of his own Friends and God's Miniſters are theſe now to be perfectly got off and cured on a ſudden and the Mind reſtored to Soundneſs and Holyneſs? Is that now to be done ſo eaſily and ſo quickly which he found ſo hard to do all his life, and which is one of the hardeſt and moſt difficult things in the World to make a Bad Man a Good one? No this is Unnatural and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible and cannot be in the Nature of the thing, but a Man may be very ſorrowful and heartily troubled that he was not ſo, and have great trouble and remorſe of Mind for his ſins, and ſo be heartily penitent for them, This is all he can be and he cannot well be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if he be in his Senſes and hath the uſe of his Reaſon, and ſees ſuch Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible danger before him as is now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable, he muſt be greatly troubled
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:103342:205"/>that he hath brought himſelf to that, that is, that he muſt ſuffer for his Sin, for he was never troubled at the Sin before nor would be now but like it and live in it ſtill if that were all, but he cannot but be concerned at the dreadful puniſhment of it, and he muſt be very hardy indeed if he go not thus Shivering and Contrite and Penitent as they call it to his Execution, this is only a Natural abhorring of pain or what is evil to us from a principle of Self-preſervation, not an abhorrence of Sin from Choice and Reaſon and free apprehenſion of Mind, for all this is from a force and violence offered to the mind by a ſenſe of preſent danger, and from that Fear, Terrour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion that a Sinner is then in, when Hell and Eternity are juſt preſented before him, then he parts with his Sins as a Man does with his Money when he has a Sword or a Piſtol held to his Breaſt, out of mere fear not out of free choice: No Man but muſt be afraid of Hell who believes it and has any ſenſe of it, and all this dying ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and Repentance ariſes only from hence; ſome I know make a mighty difference both as to the Cauſe and
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:103342:206"/>the Vertue and Efficacy of this ſorrow, if it ariſe only from the fear of Hell it is Attrition, if from the Love of God joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with it is Contrition and ſo will be more effectual, Now I am afraid the firſt is the chief ſpring if not only cauſe of it in dying Sinners, and that there is no real difference between theſe two ſorts of ſorrows in the Nature of the thing but only an over nice diſtinction in words and thoughts and in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſame thing by ſeveral mental conceptions, when the paſſion is the ſame in it ſelf and the cauſes of it are not to be ſo nicely diſtinguiſht, but whatever be the principle of this ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and however ſtrong and ſincere it be, and whatever purpoſes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions it may be joyned with, yet that this mere Mental Repentance is not true and Perfect Repentance, ſuch as the Goſpel promiſes pardon to, I have ſhown before in giving the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deſcribing the Nature of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and particularly proved how ſhort and imperfect this is <hi>in the fourth Section of the firſt Chapter,</hi> ſo that a Dying Sinner cannot then perform ſuch a full Repentance as hath a certain title to Pardon and Salvation by the
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:103342:206"/>promiſes of the Goſpel: But to ſhow further that a fooliſh unprepared Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinner can have no hopes of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into Heaven by all he can then do, and that his moſt earneſt Prayers and Entreaties, his Cryes and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, his Wiſhes and Purpoſes and Reſolutions, and all the parts of his dying Repentance put together are not ſufficient to do this, <hi>as the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble here ſuppoſes,</hi> I ſhall produce ſome more Poſitive and Expreſs Proofs and as I think convincing Arguments againſt this Efficacy and Validity of a Death-Bed Repentance.</p>

                  <p>FIrſt, It does no way come up to the plain and indiſpenſable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Salvation required by the Goſpel, for thoſe are no other than Faith and Obedience, believing the Goſpel and living according to it, which are the plain and only pathway to Heaven by Chriſtianity, and he that thinks of Chriſts bringing him thither any other way, abuſes his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and his Religion, and puts a wretched cheat upon himſelf. I know Faith and Repentance and Faith alone are often ſet down as the only Terms and Conditions of Salvation by the Goſpel, but then they are to be taken not in a ſtrict and narrow ſenſe, but in a large one, as they include all that belongs and is conſequent to them, all that Obedience and new Chriſtian Life which is made as plain a Condition of Salvation by the Goſpel as Faith it ſelf, and Repentance I have ſhown
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:103342:207"/>plainly takes thoſe in, ſo that the whole Practical Condition of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is meant by them. Faith is the firſt Principle and Foundation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Obedience and all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Vertues, and therefore as including and containing thoſe is made the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our being ſaved by a <hi>Meto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymy,</hi> whereby the Cauſe compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends alſo the Effect. Faith does ſo plainly in Scripture mean not only an aſſent to anothers words, or a truſt and affiance in them, but that <hi>which worketh by love, Gal.</hi> 5.5. and that which produces good Works and is dead without them, that 'tis a ſtrange miſtake to make <hi>that</hi> the Condition of our being juſtified and ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Obedience, 'Tis to be obſerved, and I think it may help to clear this matter, that when Faith and Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is made the only Condition of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaved and nothing elſe is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, this is alwayes ſpoken to thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> or Heathens who were not yet Chriſtians and Believers, and the only way for them to be ſaved was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and embrace Chriſtianity and become Diſciples of Chriſt: As when Chriſt ſayes, <hi>John</hi> 3.15. <hi>Whoſoever
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:103342:208"/>believeth on the Son of Man ſhall not periſh but have everlaſting life:</hi> This is ſpoken to <hi>Nicodemus</hi> who then expreſt his disbelief of Chriſts words, and was not brought fully to believe in him though he was diſpoſed to it. So <hi>John</hi> 6.40. when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>This is the will of him that ſent me, that every one which ſeeth the Son and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on him may have everlaſting life:</hi> This is ſpoken to the <hi>Jews</hi> who mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured at Chriſt and were far from believing in him. And ſo Chriſt bid the Apoſtles preach this to the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving World, <hi>Whoſoever believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved, Matth.</hi> 16.16. <hi>i.e.</hi> believing and profeſſing Chriſtianity puts them into a ſalvable ſtate, and if they live according to this Faith they ſhall certainly be ſaved. As if we ſhould ſay to a Perſon who deſires to know how he may be a Schollar, Go to School or to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity; This would put him into a certain way to Learning, but he muſt not only be enter'd and enroll'd and matriculated there, but muſt ſtudy and read and do ſuch things as belong to a Schollar. When St. <hi>Peter</hi> advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the <hi>Jews who were pricked to the
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:103342:208"/>heart, Acts</hi> 2.37. and St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Jaylor when he ask'd <hi>what muſt I do to be ſaved,</hi> that they ſhould <hi>believe in Chriſt and repent,</hi> They meant thereby turn Chriſtians, which would put them into a ſalvable ſtate, but then they muſt perform all the other things which belong to Chriſtians as well as have this Faith, or elſe they would loſe and forfeit this their good ſtate. When Chriſt therefore ſpeaks to his Diſciples who already believed in him, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> writes to thoſe who were Chriſtians and Believers, they tell them not only of Faith, which is the firſt Chriſtian Vertue and the root of all the reſt, but of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and of all good Works, of living <hi>as becometh the Goſpel,</hi> and adorning their Profeſſion with all manner of Vertues which they make as neceſſary to Salvation as Faith it ſelf: Thus <hi>if ye keep my commandments</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>ye ſhall abide in my love, John</hi> 15.20. <hi>And ye are my friends if ye do whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I command you,</hi> ver. 14. <hi>And not every one that ſaith unto me, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doth the will of my Father which is in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 7.21.
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:103342:209"/>
                     <hi>If ye know theſe things happy are ye if ye do them,</hi> John 13.17. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians, Circumciſion is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nor uncircumciſion, but keeping the Commandments of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.19. and to the <hi>Galatians, In Chriſt Jeſus neither circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but a new creature,</hi> Gal. 6.15. <hi>For by the goſpel the wrath of God is revealed from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of men, who hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 1.18. <hi>And when the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels he will take vengeance on all them that obey not his goſpel, who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.8, 9. And thoſe Chriſtians who do any ſuch works of the Fleſh as are mentioned <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19, 21. <hi>ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> but <hi>for the ſake of thoſe the wrath of God cometh on the children of diſobedience, Coloſ.</hi> 3.6. Theſe things are as clear as if they were writ with a Sun-beam, ſo that none, one would think, who reads the Goſpel ſhould ſuppoſe Faith alone
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:103342:209"/>without Obedience ſhould juſtifie and ſave us, or that Chriſt is a Saviour to any but <hi>thoſe who obey him, Heb.</hi> 5.9. ſince <hi>bleſſed are they who do his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, for they only have right to the tree of life, Rev.</hi> 22.14. From all which it is plain, that Obedience to the Laws of the Goſpel is the only and the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable Condition of our Salvation.</p>
                  <p>And indeed this is the very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Chriſts giving us ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Laws, that we ſhould obey them and be happy for ever by doing ſo, and if we do not, but live wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, we muſt be eternally miſerable. It had been in vain for God to have given us any Laws, or commanded us any thing, if he had not given them ſuch a Sanction, and obliged us to them by ſuch Rewards and Penalties; and therefore if Mens heads were not bewildred with odd ſchemes and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes about decrees and ſtrange me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Salvation, this would be the firſt and plaineſt Principle in all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as 'tis the trueſt, and there would never be any diſpute about it, that if Men live well here they ſhall be for ever happy, if ill for ever miſerable. However ignorant Men call this a

And what is a Future Judgment but to reward all Men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their works? where God as a Juſt and Impartial Judge ſhall <hi>without reſpect of perſons judge accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to every mans work,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. And <hi>every one ſhall receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. For <hi>when the Son of Man ſhall come in the glory of his Father with his Angels, then he ſhall reward every man according to his works,</hi> Matth. 16.27. <hi>In the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, he will render to every man according to his deeds,</hi> Rom. 2.6. <hi>To them who by patient continuance in well doing ſeek
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:103342:211"/>for glory, and honour, and immortality; eternal life: But unto them that obey not the truth but obey unrighteouſneſs, tribulation and anguiſh upon every ſoul of man that doth evil, ver.</hi> 8, 9. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be plainer than this in the whole Goſpel, that Men muſt expect to receive hereafter according to the goodneſs or badneſs of their Lives here, and that the only Condition of their Salvation is Obedience to the Laws of the Goſpel. 'Tis a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed miſunderſtanding and a total de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying of Chriſtianity, to ſet up any looſe Principles of Faith and Free-Grace or the like, which are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with this, and to delude our ſelves with hopes of Salvation by Chriſt upon any other Condition or by any other Means than this of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
                  <p>God indeed hath granted us this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and priviledge by the Goſpel, that though we have diſobeyed him ſometime and ſome part of our lives, yet if we come off from this Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and return to our Duty in time, and performe Obedience to him for the future, that then he will forgive our former Diſobedience and not charge it
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:103342:212"/>upon us nor puniſh us for it, but gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly pardon it for the ſake of Chriſt and his meritorious ſufferings, and that he will receive us again into his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and reward us for our new Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience as if we had never done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, but had been always obedient and <hi>never tranſgreſt his Commandments;</hi> This is the great grace and favour and priviledge of the Goſpel, and this is what we call Repentance, for Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is the ſame thing with Obedience, only it comes after Diſobedience, 'tis a Mans living well after he has lived otherwiſe, which takes in Obedience and a good Life, though after a bad one, 'tis like a Mans ſetting up again after he had once broke, when after his kind Creditor has been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to compound with him and inſtead of his whole Debt, <hi>to wit,</hi> an entire and Univerſal Obedience all his Life to accept of ſuch a partial and broken one, he may again thrive and grow rich and ſo get free from his former poverty; or as I have often repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Nature of Repentance, 'tis like a Mans recovering health and ſtrength and ſoundneſs of body after he has been weak and ill or diſtempered in
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:103342:212"/>the whole or any part; Health and Strength is the ſame to him that it was before, though he had once loſt it, as Riches is to the other now he hath got them again after he was broke; ſo 'tis the ſame vertue of Mind which we ought always to have have had that Repentance reſtores us to, and 'tis the ſame Obedience to God's Laws which a Penitent performs upon his return to his duty that he ſhould have performed before, and 'tis this only that commends him to God and gives him a title to the promiſes of the Goſpel and procures Pardon and Salvation to him.</p>
                  <p>'Tis God's infinite Mercy in and through Chriſt to allow and accept of this <hi>After</hi> Obedience as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our Salvation when it is ſo broken and interrupted whereas the whole Obedience of our Lives is due to God, and he might refuſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of this lame and after and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect one, but ſtill 'tis Obedience to Gods Laws after we have broken them by our ſins, 'tis this Obedience renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>ex poſtliminio</hi> as I may call it, that recommends us to his favour, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains our pardon for what is paſt, and entitles us again to the reward
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:103342:213"/>we had forfeited, and without this we can never be reconciled to God nor received into Heaven, for none ſhall go thither but the Vertuous and Obedient whither they have always been ſo, or only after they have been otherwiſe, but ſtill they muſt be Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and they muſt be Obedient, or elſe they can never come thither, for 'tis certain Obedience, which if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Diſobedience in any inſtance is call'd Repentance, is by the Goſpel the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and indiſpenſable Condition of our Happyneſs and Salvation:</p>
                  <p>Now no Man can in any ſenſe call the Sorrows and Remorſes and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of dying Sinners Goſpel Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but only a trouble and concern for the want of it and for the diſobedience of their whole lives; There would be no difference between Obedience and Diſobedience if this were ſo, No Maſter or Father would account him an Obedient Servant or Obedient Son who ſhould only confeſs and be ſorry that he had always diſobeyed him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til upon this his ſorrow he ſhowed himſelf Obedient for the future and did him ſome faithful Service. How long a Man muſt be Obedient after he
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:103342:213"/>hath been Diſobedient or how long time is required for a Sinner who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents to come off from his Sins and become a good Man is hard to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine exactly, but there muſt be ſo much time as ſhall make a Drunkard ſober, a Whoremonger chaſt, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Man Righteous, a Swearer and Prophane Perſon Devout and Pious, the Covetous Man Juſt and Charitable, and the like, for we are aſſured that whilſt Men are ſuch Sinners as any of thoſe, <hi>they have no inheritance in the kingdom of Chriſt and of God, Epheſ.</hi> 5.5. and therefore they muſt ſo long obey the Laws of God till they are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly become and may be denominated Sober Juſt Charitable Pure Holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and the like, for Heaven is a place only for ſuch Men and ſuch Souls as are thus qualified and who have obeyed Gods Laws ſo long till they are become thus; It ſhall never be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to thoſe who have been diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to God all their lives and can now performe no acts of Obedience to him, ſuch can never perform that Indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable Condition of Salvation required by the Goſpel, and nothing leſs then this will do, there is no ſuch disjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:103342:214"/>any where in the Bible that I know of, to this ſenſe, Be Holy and Obedient and lead a Good Life in order to be Fternally happy, or elſe Repent and be Sorry for not doing it when you come to dye, but only thus where you have ſinned and been diſobedient for the time paſt, Repent and be Obedient for the time to come, and this ſhall be accepted, as in that known place, <hi>when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedneſs which he hath committed, and doth that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſave his ſoul alive, Ezek.</hi> 18.27. 'Tis <hi>his doing that which is lawful and right, i. e.</hi> his Obedience for the future, <hi>ſhall ſave his ſoul alive; all his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions that he hath committed they ſhall not be mentioned unto him</hi> upon his new Obedience or Repentance, <hi>in his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs that he hath done ſhall he live, ver.</hi> 22. it muſt be Righteouſneſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, or his obeying God after his former diſobedience ſhall entitle him to Life and Happyneſs, and be the Condition of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As Obedience is the only term and condition of our Salvation by the Goſpel, ſo there is no juſt reaſon or good ground to hope that God will in
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:103342:214"/>any caſe abate of the termes of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he hath there lay'd down, or be mercyful beyond thoſe, for two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe this would be neither conſiſtent with the Holineſs of his Nature, nor the wiſdom of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, for as he is a Holy and Righteous God he cannot love any but a righteous and good Soul, and ſo cannot make any other happy becauſe a wicked and impure Soul is contrary to his Nature and what he hates and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates and what can never ſee or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy God; neither is it conſiſtent with the Wiſdom of God as Governour of the World to reward any but the obedient and the righteous, for it would reflect upon his Juſtice and his Authority if he ſhould ſuffer Men to go on in their Wickedneſs and Diſobedience all their lives, and not puniſh them for it; Mercy indeed and Clemency is the Honour of any Prince and that which commends him to the love and eſteem of all, but then it muſt be ſhown wiſely to proper and fit Objects and for good Reaſons, to bring Men in to their Duty, and draw them off from their Diſobedience with the promiſe
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:103342:215"/>of a Pardon upon their doing ſo, and returning to their Allegiance. But if a Prince ſhall grant this to all ſort of Offenders out of the weakneſs and ſoftneſs of his Temper, he will looſen his Government, and weaken his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and make himſelf cheap and contemptible, and as he will encourage Rogues and Rebels, ſo he will injure the Publick, and not take due care as becomes a wiſe Governour of the Common good; ſhould God grant a full and abſolute pardon to Sinners who have lived never ſo long in their ſins becauſe they are very ſorry for them when they come to dye and they can live in them no longer, this would encourage Men who love their Sins to continue in 'em all their lives and then Repent at laſt, and ſo ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the trouble, as they think it, of living a very good life. God indeed has promiſed pardon to all who repent and turn from their ſins, and live good and holy lives after they have lived bad ones, and this is ſufficient encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to make a wicked Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a good one with the certain hopes that when he does ſo God will receive him, but to go farther and ſuppoſe
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:103342:215"/>God to pardon a long wicked life ſpent altogether in Sin and Diſobedience merely for a little ſorrow and remorſe and trouble when Men come to dye is to open a wide Door to vice and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and to ſuperſede the neceſſity of Obedience and a good life and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould God grant this, it would deſtroy Religion, and take off the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to Vertue, and make all his Motives to Obedience and Threatnings againſt Sin to be void, empty and ineffectual.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is no Reaſon to think God will abate of the termes of the Goſpel, and be more merciful than he has there promiſed to be becauſe as the Goſpel ſeems to contain the utmoſt Grace and Mercy that God can ſhow to Men, ſo it ſhall certainly be the Rule of the laſt judgment, and God will then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed and pronounce judgment ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules and Meaſures of that; 'tis the moſt vain and impudent thing in the World to expect any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mercy than God has revealed to vs by Jeſus Chriſt, He hath in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility ſhown the utmoſt kindneſs and favour that is poſſible to Mankind for his ſake, he has opened the bowels of
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:103342:216"/>his Mercy and <hi>the Riches of his Grace</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. and has exhauſted all the treaſures of love and compaſſion to poor Sinners that a Wiſe and Juſt God can poſſibly ſhow with conſiſtence to his own honour and the honour of his Laws and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to expect therefore that God ſhould be gracious beyond the Goſpel, and make farther and greater abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to us, and be more merciful than he hath promiſed to be by his Son whom he ſent with the moſt full and gratious Meſſage of loving kindneſs that we could reaſonably deſire or God in wiſdom grant is a moſt groundleſs and unreaſonable preſumption which makes void all Gods threatnings and is a direct disbelief of his word, and expreſly contrary to what is plainly delared by the Goſpel it ſelf, for in that Chriſt aſſures us that <hi>the word which he has</hi> there <hi>ſpoken, the ſame ſhall judge men at the laſt day, John</hi> 12.48. and therefore he will judge us by no other rule, nor uſe any other meaſures in diſpoſing his Mercy or his Juſtice to his Creatures than what he hath layd down, and made known to us by the Goſpel; <hi>God ſhall judge the world,</hi> ſays
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:103342:216"/>St. <hi>Paul, in that day according to my Goſpel, Rom.</hi> 2.16. 'Tis not therefore to be expected that God ſhould uſe any other Judgment or ſhow any other Mercy to Sinners than what is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the termes of the Goſpel and the Conditions of Salvation there lay'd down, and a Death-Bed Repentance doth not as I have ſhown come up to thoſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I have ſhowed all along this Diſcourſe that it is not ſuch a True and Perfect Repentance as the Scripture promiſes Pardon and Salvation to, for that conſiſts not only in ſorrow and trouble of Mind, conviction of Soul, and Compunction of heart, but in actual Reformation and new Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and indeed 'tis this alone is a Mans retracting his paſt folly and wickedneſs and being wiſer for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, undoing all the evil he has done as much as he can and doing all the good he can for the time to come, and ſo making all poſſible amends to the honour of Religion, and the honour of God which have been highly injured and violated by him, and though he can never make perfect reparation and ſatisfaction to them, and therefore
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:103342:217"/>Chriſt alone did this by his Death and Sufferings, yet he is to do all that he is able and that is in his power to do, that he may thereby vindicate the Divine Authority and Government which he hath oppoſed and reſiſted and Juſtifie the wiſdom and goodneſs, juſtice and holineſs of the Laws of Heaven which he hath broken and contemned, and ſo make all the compenſation he is able to repair the ſad Miſchief he hath done by his Sins. We truly ſay, that no injury to another perſon will be forgiven but upon Reſtitution and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all the reparation for it that can be, becauſe 'till this is done the ſin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains and the evil effects of it continue and till a Man is willing to undoe that as far as he is able, to take away and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all the effects of it, he keeps the ſin and does not truly Repent of it, nor wiſh it undone, now ſurely we owe as much to God and Religion in Juſtice as we do to our Equals and where we have done any thing to injure thoſe, as our ſins are the greateſt injury to them we can be guilty of, there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo we muſt make as much reſtitution and reparation as we are able, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe the ſins we have committed by a
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:103342:217"/>more zealous and hearty and new Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and making up, if it were poſſible, the paſt failures and defects of our Sinful Lives by greater care and zeal and diligence for the future. We may do this by a timely Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but by a late and a dying one we cannot.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A Sinner cannot be then freed at his Death from what will neceſſarily make him miſerable, his Sinful Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, which will ſink his Soul into Hell by a Natural Cauſality as well as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Judgment: God has expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that <hi>neither fornicators, nor ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abuſers of themſelves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, nor ſuch like ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. And who are ſuch but they who have lived in the habit of any of thoſe Sins? And are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be denominated and accounted ſuch from the general practice of their Lives, and have not <hi>been waſhed and ſanctified,</hi> or made better, but only are now ſorry for being ſo when they are dying; If Sorrow would make Men to be otherwiſe and their Tears
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:103342:218"/>alone would blot out this black Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter without a contrary Practice, there would hardly be any ſuch to be found, though 'tis plain the World is too full of them. There would be no Thief or Felon or Traytor at any Aſſizes or Court of Judicature, if when they came to be tryed and were found guilty, and were to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, their meer ſorrow and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble would ſet them right, and change their character, and make them to be accounted otherwiſe in the eye of the Law. But beſides this Sentence and Judgment of God upon all kind of Sinners whereby he bars any ſuch from Heaven, and adjudges them to Hell, their Sins Naturally ſink them thither, for that is the true place and center of Wickedneſs, and therefore of Miſery. Filthy and impure Minds fall into it by a kind of Spiritual Gravitation, or by ſuch a Conſtitution of the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Intellectual World, which as neceſſarily carries them thither as the Mechaniſm of this material World carries a ſtone downward. So that 'tis as unavoidable for a Sinner loaded with his wicked Habits to fall into Hell and Miſery in another World, as if here
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:103342:218"/>he had a Millſtone tyed about his neck, and were caſt into the Sea to fall to the bottom of it. The weight of his Sins will of it ſelf preſs and ſink him down into the utmoſt gulph of Miſery; and when he is quite ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from the diverſions and pleaſures and bodily enjoyments of this World, and is left wholly to the reflections and agonies and diſmal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of his own Mind, his Conſcience which is now ſtupified and amuſed with other imaginary plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Body and this World will then awaken and fall upon him with all its rage, and torment his Soul and make it unexpreſſibly miſerable were there no other ſentence or judgment upon him. The dreadful horrors and apprehenſions of his own Mind let looſe upon him would always be a very great torment and Hell to him, if he had nothing to relieve or divert him, but was left naked and open to the full ſtroke of his Conſcience, and his thoughts were whollytaken up with the frightful Images and Ideas of his own Guilt, and overwhelmed with all the bitter Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Fear, Sorrow and Deſpair, as they will hereafter. Sin will as certainly fill
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:103342:219"/>him with thoſe in another World and cauſe ſuch painful ſenſations or percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions within his Soul as he now feels in his Body upon a torturing Diſeaſe, or any inſtrument of Cruelty applyed to it; for <hi>that</hi> is as contrary to the Nature and Frame of the one as thoſe are to the other, and they would be alwayes felt here if the Body did not drown and ſtifle and choak the free and natural thoughts of the Mind, which it cannot hereafter. If the Mind therefore be not freed from its Sins and Evil Habits it will neceſſarily be miſerable with them in another World. It can ſometimes avoid thoſe inward pains and torments here becauſe it has the gratifications of its Sins, and other enjoyments and entertainments to bear it up, and yet they will often get in and diſturb it even amidſt all its plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and jollities, but in its ſeparate Eſtate hereafter it will be wholly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoſe and ſo for ever ſubject to the inward miſery and uneaſineſs which Sin ever cauſes in its own thoughts.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Allowing Salvation to a meer dying Repentance, as it ſeems contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all plain Notions and certain Principles in Religion, namely, that
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:103342:219"/>none but Vertuous and good Men can go to Heaven, and that Obedience and a good Life is the only way thither, and that Vice while it continues upon the Mind will neceſſarily make it mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, and the like, which I have largely inſiſted upon. So,</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The conſequences of it ſeem plainly to deſtroy all Religion. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It ſets by all thoſe general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands which are often given to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, of Walking worthy of their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, adorning their profeſſion, and letting their converſation be as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the goſpel. Letting their light ſo ſhine before men that others may ſee their good works, and ſo glorifie their Father which is in Heaven. Doing all to the Glory of God, and promoting that and Religion as much and as far as they can in the World, Learning of Chriſt and following his Example, and ſhowing they are his Diſciples by bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much fruit, Doing all the good they can to others, and being uſeful in their places, improving their Talents, and not being unprofitable Servants, Redeeming the time, and taking all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of ſerving the great ends of Religion, Growing in Grace and being
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:103342:220"/>perfect, <hi>as their Father which is in Heaven is perfect.</hi> Theſe are general Commands given to Chriſtians, and ſuch as they are all obliged to, though not in the higheſt degrees yet in ſuch meaſures as God who knows our frame and our circumſtances intended we ſhould come up to. They are not only Counſels of Perfection, and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick unpracticable Directions of ſome Acts of Supererogation, but they are ſtrict Rules of neceſſary Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Chriſtian practice which every good Chriſtian is bound to live up to, and if they wholly fail in doing ſo, and do no way make them good in their Lives but act contrary to them, they are not good Chriſtians at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent nor ſhall be rewarded as ſuch hereafter, but ſhall be condemned and puniſhed eternally for being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Now a notorious wretched Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner who hath been ſo far from having any regard to theſe Chriſtian obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that he hath lived all his Life in direct oppoſition againſt them, and now only Repents when he is a dying, he muſt be wholly excuſed from all theſe, they muſt be all ſet aſide and ſignifie nothing in his caſe if he can go
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:103342:220"/>to Heaven not only without obſerving them in any ſort or any tolerable manner, but living wholly oppoſite and reverſe to them; for He inſtead of adorning his Profeſſion, and letting his Converſation be ſuch as becometh the Goſpel, hath been the greateſt ſhame and reproach to it, and been unworthy the name of it, and ſhall he now then ſhare in the nobleſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of it? Inſtead of letting his Light ſhine before Men he hath been an example of the greateſt Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and diſhonoured God in the higheſt manner all his days, and ſhall he now be rewarded and honoured by him? Inſtead of learning of Chriſt and living up to the example he ſet us, he hath learn'd of the Devil, and liv'd like a Bruit, and practiced all ſort of Diabolical and Beſtial Wickedneſs, and ſhall he now reign with Chriſt and be taken up into Paradiſe with him? Inſtead of doing any good, he hath done all the miſchief imaginable in corrupting and debauching others, and tempting them to all manner of lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and inſtead of promoting Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion he hath ſerved the cauſe of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm and Irreligion, and done all he
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:103342:221"/>can to make others disbelieve the truth of all Religion, if not by lewd Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples yet by lewd Practices that are the greateſt contradiction to it, and ſhall he now partake of its Glorious Promiſes which he hardly believed and would never ſeek after all his Life? Inſtead of improving his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents in his Maſters Service he hath wholly waſted and conſumed them in Luxury and Prodigality, and ſpent all the Bleſſings God had intruſted him with to quite other purpoſes than he gave them. Inſtead of growing in Grace he hath grown to the utmoſt perfection almoſt of Sin and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and is become a Sinner of the higheſt rate, and hath dayly impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in it. Inſtead of redeeming the time he hath ſquandered it all away in folly and madneſs, and took all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to gratifie his Luſts, and ſpent his whole Life in the perſuit of ſinful pleaſures, and now indeed he would redeem the time in a wonderful manner, and do all the buſineſs of Life very compendiouſly and very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely in a few days or hours before he is to dye: And when he hath follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed none of theſe Chriſtian Rules and
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:103342:221"/>Directions, but acted altogether againſt them, yet he would have God ſet them all by, and make them all have no meaning or be to no purpoſe, but only a little dying Sorrow and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to ſerve inſtead of all of them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As thoſe general Commands muſt be ſet aſide by this priviledge of a dying Repentance, ſo muſt alſo thoſe particular Commands which oblige us to the practice of ſeveral Vertues, ſuch as Piety and Devotion, Sobriety and Temperance, Purity and Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Self-denyal, Heavenlymindedneſs, overcoming the World, governing our Paſſions and Appetites, mortifying the Fleſh with the Affections and Luſts, and the like: For 'tis too late ſure to begin to practice thoſe when a Man is juſt upon dying if he has neglected it all his Life? Shall he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin then to mortifie the Fleſh which he hath gratified alwayes before with the moſt unlawful Luſts and forbidden Pleaſures, but now Sickneſs mortifies it indeed, and Death will do ſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, and he would have this Vertue as much in his Coffin or his Grave, when he lyes cold there, as he
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:103342:222"/>can pretend to it now; his Luſts do then dye with his Body, as a Candle goes out when all the nouriſhment is ſpent that ſhould maintain it. Is he now to govern his Paſſions and Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites when both the cauſes and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of them are removed? Is he to provide againſt the heat of the Sun when it is juſt Night or Winter with him, and make a bank to ſtop the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent when the water is all dryed up? Is he to overcome the World when he is leaving it, with an odd ſort of <hi>Parthian</hi> victory? Is he then to be Heavenly minded when he never minded Heaven before, but now 'tis the next thing when he can mind the Earth no longer? Is he then to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice Self-denyal when he never deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf any Worldly Intereſt or Senſual Pleaſure before on the ſcore of Religion, and now he denyes thoſe and his Life both alike, becauſe he cannot keep them? Is he now to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to practice the Vertues of Chaſtity and Temperance and Sobriety, which he never did before? then he hath put them off to a very convenient ſeaſon when his Vices have quite left him, and ſo if Vertues will come of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:103342:222"/>like gueſts uninvited, there is no other company to hinder them, but he was as vertuous and ſober almoſt half his Life, I mean when he was aſleep, as he can be now when he is as incapable of the contrary acts as he was then; and is only like the Enthuſiaſt cured of ſeeing vanity when he loſt his Eyes, but perhaps not of being vain, for the ghoſts and ſpirits of his departed Sins may ſtill haunt and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs him. If theſe Chriſtian Vertues are neceſſary to be practiced in order to our Eternal Salvation, a dying Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance cannot be ſufficient without them; if it be, then thoſe particular Precepts and Commands muſt be ſet aſide by it, as well as the other gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ones I mentioned, for 'tis certain he can no more practice theſe Vertues now than he could in his Mothers Womb, and they might be as well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into him then as they can be now without any practice, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better, becauſe there were then no contrary Habits to hinder them: But the Doctrine of infuſed Habits is like the Hypotheſis of Transfuſion of Blood contrary to Nature and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; and the dying Man may as
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:103342:223"/>well depend upon one for his Body as the other for his Soul.</p>

The ſalvability and ſufficiency of a meer dying Repentance as it ſets by and diſcharges us from all thoſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and particular Commands of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, ſo alſo from the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian engagement and Baptiſmal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: For can that then be any way made good or performed in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure when a Man has violated it all his Life, and notoriouſly broken it in all the parts that belong to it? Can he then ſufficiently renounce the Devil and all his works when he hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto complyed with them? the pomps and vanities of this wicked World when he has minded nothing elſe? and the ſinful Lufts of the Fleſh when he has followed them and been led by them all his dayes? Can he then keep Gods Commandments who hath broken moſt of them? and walk in the ſame all the dayes of his Life who hath walked all his days in the ways of Sin and the paths of Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and never left them till juſt now he is at his journeys end and can live no longer? Surely this Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal Covenant is made only <hi>pro
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:103342:223"/>formâ</hi> and is but a modiſh and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly Ceremony at our entring into Chriſtianity if we are not more obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſtand to it and make it good, and expect the benefits of Chriſtianity upon our ſo doing, in ſome further and better manner of performance than a wicked Chriſtian can do when he comes to dye? If his meer Sorrows and Purpoſes and Reſolutions will ſerve inſtead of all that is expreſly or implicitely meant by it, it is void and null in all the other parts of it, and the Church has unfaithfully and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincerely drawn it up in other words of a different ſenſe and meaning that ſignifie nothing, and the Scripture hath expreſt it as odly and unfitly, when it ſpeaks of our dying to Sin and riſing unto Righteouſneſs by our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, <hi>That we are</hi> ſymbolically <hi>buried with Chriſt by baptiſm unto death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed up by the glory of the Father even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of life,</hi> Rom. 6.4. <hi>For if we have been planted together in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his death, we ſhall be alſo in the likneſs of his reſurrection, Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:103342:224"/>that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin; for he that is dead is free from ſin,</hi> ver. 5, 6, 7. <hi>Likewiſe reckon ye alſo your ſelves to be dead indeed unto ſin, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live unto God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> ver. 11. <hi>Let not ſin therefore reign in your mortal body that ye ſhould obey it in the luſts thereof: Neither yield ye your members as inſtruments of unrighteouſneſs unto ſin, but yield your ſelves unto God as thoſe that are alive from the dead, and your members as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of righteouſneſs unto God,</hi> ver. 12.13. Here is enough to give us the plain meaning of Baptiſm, and the great obligation of it to renounce Sin and live a good and holy Life. And we are then ſaid to put on Chriſt and <hi>to put on the new man which after God is created in righteouſneſs and true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Eph. 4.24. and <hi>to put off con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the former converſation the old man which is corrupt according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful luſts,</hi> ver. 22. and to be rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated and born again, and have a Spiritual Principle of Life and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs communicated to our Souls, and we then voluntarily conſent to the terms of Chriſtianity. and ſolemnly engage and undertake to live accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:103342:224"/>to them, now all this which is very great and very obliging, one would think, is made very little, and very eaſily took off and abated and diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with if when it has been utterly neglected and diſregarded, violated and broken all our lives a mere ſhort and Dying Repentance will make it up and ſupply all the failures and the whole non-performance of it; I own that true and timely Repentance will relieve us againſt the many failures and breaches of it by bringing us to performe it better afterwards, ſincerely endeavouring to make it good when we have broken it by any wilful ſin, and upon our performance of it though not with perfect exactneſs yet with ſincere integrity depends our Title to all the Priviledges of Chriſtianity, But now to have no regard to it or take any care to obſerve it nor make it any way good in our lives but to live looſely and wickedly as if we had no ſuch ſtrict Engagement and Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon us and to allow our ſelves in notorious Sins and unlawful Liberties expreſly contrary to our Baptiſmal Covenant, and yet think to ſalve all and have the whole benefit of it by
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:103342:225"/>a ſhort Sorrow and Repentance when we come to dye this is either to make it have no meaning at all, or that we are not obliged to the performance of it; but let us not deceive our ſelves whoſoever doth not make good his Baptiſmal Covenant in his Life which a wicked Man cannot at his Death, as he is falſe to Chriſt and breaks his own moſt ſolemn and voluntary engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo he forfeits all the benefits of his Chriſtianity, all that Pardon and Salvation which Chriſt hath purchaſed and propoſed to him.</p>
                  <p>Thus all the Obligations to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Holineſs and Obedience layd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us either by our own Baptiſmal Vows and Promiſes or by the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular or general Commands of God and our Saviour are all taken away and diſſolved by this looſe Doctrine of a Death-Bed Regentance being ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for Salvation, ſo far as this is allowed in the caſe of one who hath been a great Sinner all his life, ſo far there muſt be an exception to all thoſe, and they muſt all ſtand by and be ſet aſide to make room for his going to Heaven. All the Laws of Religion and the whole Conſtitution of Chriſtianity,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:103342:225"/>and all the ordinary Rules and the ſtanding Method of Salvation by the Goſpel muſt be paſt by and over-ruled to make way for ſuch an Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Preſident, and whether God will do this is to me no more a queſtion than whether he will releaſe the Devils and the Damned out of Hell, I think there is ſcarce any more ground or more reaſon to hope for one than the other, and that 'tis as much a limiting the Divine Grace and Mercy and Confining Gods Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Power of ſhowing Mercy where he pleaſes, and denying his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Pity and Compaſſion to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and entring into his unſearchable Councils, and diving into his unfatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Judgment to deny the latter as the former.</p>
                  <p>If God in one caſe may act contrary to all Rules and to his own Threatnings Judgment and Sentence pronounced againſt Sinners he may do ſo, ſo far as I know by the ſame Extraordinary Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and unbounded Prerogative in the other.</p>
                  <p>But what ſhall we ſay then to ſuch a wretched Sinner when he is a dying, and never repented till he was ſo, is his caſe hopeleſs and deſperate? Is
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:103342:226"/>there no comfort to be given him, is this hard and cruel Sentence to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced upon him? And is he to be thus tormented before his time? Can nothing be done or ſaid to him to give him any manner of hopes and comfort. and is he to be caſt into the deepeſt gulph of deſpair? What a Miſerable Comforter muſt a Miniſter whom he then ſends for be to him who is of this Opinion, and talks at this rate? What will all his Prayers and Tears and ſtrong Cryes then ſignifie if they can do him no good to the ſaving of his Soul?</p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, the caſe is I confeſs very ſad and I know not what to ſay to it, I dare not pervert the Goſpel to give him falſe comfort, I muſt not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful to the great God and my bleſſed Redeemer whoſe Miniſter I am in ſaying, <hi>Peace Peace when there is no Peace,</hi> in looſing what is bound in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and by a falſe Key or Picklock rather pretend to open the Kingdom of Heaven when God has ſhut it, I muſt not by any ſweet and poyſonous Opiates give a ſhort and ſtupifying eaſe to his mind, and put him into a ſecure ſleep till he awakes in his ſad miſtake
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:103342:226"/>and <hi>lifts up his eyes being in torments,</hi> I muſt not corrupt Religion and ſow Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows under his Arm-holes to put him into a ſtate of falſe eaſe and quiet, and by ſome drops of Spiritual Laudanum, ſome comfortable falſe Doctrines and Narcotick Principles of Divinity take away his pains for a moment, and give him hopes contrary to the Goſpel; <hi>I muſt not lye for God</hi> much leſs againſt him and bring a pretended Meſſage from him to ſuch a poor Wretch which he never ſent me with, and forge a Counterfeit Pardon for him which Chriſt or the Goſpel has not ſigned only to chear and delude him for a few hours. I muſt not I dare not then ſay any thing contrary to the Truth or to this Doctrine, which I believe to be ſuch, to deceive him or others. It may not be then ſo ſeaſonable, nor am I bound at that time to preach this to him as I do now to the living that they may never come to this ſad Condition, but may take care to prevent it by a time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Repentance and a good Life, I would not for Ten Thouſand Worlds be in that lamentable Caſe, and I here warn every one that Reads this, in the Name of God to avoid it:</p>
                  <pb n="430" facs="tcp:103342:227"/>
                  <p>But what then ſhall ſuch an one do, ſhall he not pray ſhall he not cry migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to God, ſhall he not lament and mourn and be deeply ſorrowful and penitent? Yes by all means as much as is poſſible, and ſhould be directed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed and aſſiſted to do this by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter and his Friends and all about him; but what will it ſignifie accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the former Doctrine? 'Twill not ſave his Soul or get him Heaven; I anſwer I cannot ſay it will nor can any Miniſter aſſure him of this, but it will abate his miſery and leſſen his torments and be a great mitigation to his future puniſhment, it will though not obtain a pardon for all the ſins of his wicked life, yet lighten his Sentence in ſome meaſure and make his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings to be ſomething leſs than they would otherwiſe be.</p>
                  <p>There are many degrees of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Puniſhment even in Hell it ſelf, as there are of Glory and Happyneſs in Heaven, as there <hi>are many Manſions</hi> above in our Fathers Houſe, ſo there are many Cells in the Infernal Priſon, and ſome are <hi>beaten</hi> there <hi>with more ſtripes</hi> and more intenſe torments than others. The fire of Hell is kindled ſeven times hotter for
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:103342:227"/>ſome more profligate and daring and preſumptuous Sinners, and eſpecially for thoſe who defie Heaven and with their laſt breath deny or affront God and openly ſcorn and diſown Religion, ſuch bold Hectors againſt Heaven who ſtand out to the laſt againſt it and ſhow no ſigns of Sorrow or Religion, but brave Hell and Death theſe provoke God to the utmoſt and challenge him as it were to do his worſt, and they ſhall terribly feel the weight of his Power, and the force of his Almighty Arme and the Effects of his moſt incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and provoked Anger, but now a Penitent and fearful and ſorrowful Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner who trembles at Gods Judgments, and is afraid of his indignation, and laments over his Sins, and humbles himſelf under his hand, and Repents as well as he can and bitterly grieves for his Sins and owns God is juſt and righteous in puniſhing him and that 'tis the due deſert of his ways and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes them before Men and warns others from them, and does all he can to undoe them and make reparation for them, and thus owns Religion though he has before denyed and oppoſed it and gives Glory to God though he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:103342:228"/>diſhonoured and diſobeyed him in his life, ſuch an one though for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons before given he has not a ſufficient Title nor ſufficient Qualifications for Heaven becauſe he has not performed the Condition on which 'tis promiſed nor can acquire the Vertuous Habits that can alone fit him for it, nor can come up to the full terms on which God has promiſed Pardon and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all this dying Repentance is not enough to make him a truely good Man nor beget in him that <hi>holineſs without which he ſhall never ſee God,</hi> nor root out thoſe old ſinful Acts and Habits that will condemn and make him miſerable, yet he ſhall have a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great Abatement and Mitigation to his future Miſery and his Puniſhment ſhall be much leſſened by it: This is a very great thing if we duely conſider it and worth all his moſt earneſt Prayers and deepeſt Sorrow and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction and all he can do to ſave him from thoſe higheſt and extremeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Miſery.</p>
                  <p>Hell indeed is a general word for future Miſery in Scripture as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is for Happyneſs, but they conſiſt not in one and the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:103342:228"/>thing but are Two States of very various and different and unequal degrees according to the Deſerts and Capacities of thoſe who are in them; As there are ſeveral degrees of Good and Bad Men here upon Earth, ſo there will be of happy and miſerable Souls in Heaven and Hell, ſome are very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly but yet ſincerely good and are far from ſuch Obedience and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as Human Nature might come up to and thoſe being without any wilful and deliberate and great Sin ſhall be in the loweſt place in Heaven, and lower than this the Scripture allows none to go thither; they who live in any ſuch one known and habitual ſin and wickedneſs are ſuch Sinners as are expreſly excluded from thence, They have another place and ſtate allotted to them in the other World, for there being no third or middle ſtate revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Scripture but only thoſe two of Heaven and Hell, they muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily go to the latter, and there accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Nature or Quality or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of their Sin <hi>be puniſht with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or fewer ſtripes,</hi> and be in a ſtate of greater or leſſer Miſery according as their Lives and their Deſerts have been:</p>
                  <pb n="434" facs="tcp:103342:229"/>
                  <p>The Valley of <hi>Hinnom</hi> from whence comes <hi>Gehenna,</hi> which we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate Hell, was a deep Valley near <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> where the <hi>Canaanites</hi> burnt their Children alive to <hi>Moloch</hi> and uſed all direful noiſes to hinder their cries and lamentations from being heard, and afterwards the <hi>Jews</hi> ſay that <hi>Joſias</hi> turned it into the place of publick Executions and that all Carkaſſes and Dung and filthy things were thrown there, to prevent the noyſomneſs of which there was a perpetual fire al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways burning in that place that was never put out at any time: The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has made this the chiefeſt image and repreſentation of Hell and from thence deſcribes the Miſery of it by fire and burnings, which give one of the moſt general and ſenſible ideas of Pain and torment; Both the Spiritual Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyneſs of Heaven and Miſery of Hell muſt be thus repreſented to the groſs Thoughts of Mankind by the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful and moſt painful things known to their Senſes, that they are beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with in this World, and which will make the ſtrongeſt impreſſion upon them, though they may be in
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:103342:229"/>themſelves of another Nature fitted chiefly to the Souls and Spirits and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional faculties of Men in their ſeparate ſtate, and the happyneſs or miſery of thoſe is chiefly deſigned by them; God we know is a <hi>Conſuming fire</hi> to the wicked, but he will very differently pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them, though fire ſeems to carry one equal idea of pain and torment yet as our Saviour ſays that <hi>it ſhall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of Judgment,</hi> (and they are ſet forth for an example in Scripture, <hi>ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the vengeance of eternal fire, Jude</hi> 7.) <hi>then for that City</hi> who rejected the Goſpel, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.15. ſo it ſhall be more tolerable for ſuch wicked Men who have been ſo in a leſſer degree in their Lives and at their Deaths have been as penitent as they could be then for Sinners of an higher order and a more daring and impenitent ſort,</p>
                  <p>Heaven and Hell being taken for Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces rather than States ſeem to our Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations to imply and ſignifie one equal and indiviſible perfect and complete and ſame idea of Happyneſs or Miſery that ſhall belong to all alike who are ſentenced to either of thoſe, but there are very great Differences and Degrees
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:103342:230"/>in them, a thouſand times more than there is in the different States of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs or Miſery among Men in this World, where in the ſame place and upon the ſame Globe we ſee ſome in very happy circumſtances and mighty enjoyments, others in great Pain and Miſery and a moſt pitiable Condition, this here is only a Tryal of them, and not according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, but it ſhall be ſo exactly in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Wold, the great day of Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and Retribution; Then they who have done moſt Evil and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted moſt ſins and not repented of them in time but gon on to provoke and diſobey God and deſpiſe and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Religion all their lives, theſe ſhall ſuffer the ſad and utmoſt Vengeance of God's Anger and of Eternal fire, All other wicked Men of what ſort ſoever, whether they were <hi>Sinners above others,</hi> or only lived in ſome ſins without Repentance and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, theſe ſhall be for ever in a very bad ſtate, a ſtate of Miſery and loſs of true happineſs, and their Miſery ſhall be exactly proportioned to their ſins, and be in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees

                  <p>They then who have ſerved God beſt in their lives ſhall be beſt rewarded by him, they <hi>who have ſuffered with Chriſt ſhall then reign with him,</hi> they who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured any afflictions for his ſake and the Goſpels ſhall have the greater Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which <hi>thoſe are not to be compared to,</hi> they ſhall receive a hundred fold for all they have done or ſuffered for Chriſt, not only for ſuffering Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion though Martyrdom has always had a brighter and a weightier Crown aſſigned to it, but for denying any preſent Intereſt or worldly gain, or unlawful pleaſure and ſenſual Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the ſake of Vertue and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; then thoſe who have beſt impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their Talents to Gods Glory, and the good of others, and the Service of Religion ſhall have more gifts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from their great Lord, <hi>they who have turned many unto Righteouſneſs

                  <p>There being but two places or rather two States in another World appointed for all rational beings that ever were created, as ſeems plain by the Scripture Revelation, where ſo far as it deſcribes or gives us a Map of that Inviſible and unknown World it divides it only into two Mighty King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms or vaſt Regions an upper and a lower parted from one another by unknown bounds and inhabited by Good and Bad Spirits, where the one are very happy and the other very mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, there being but two ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles for the Souls of all Men and Angels to ſpend an Eternity in, (for the fixt continuance and Eternal Duration of their ſtate is more plainly revealed
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:103342:231"/>then their particular State and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) ſo that all Rational Souls muſt be conſigned to one of thoſe States and Places, (for they who have made a Third or Fourth have made it only out of their own brains and imaginations not out of any Scriptural foundation or Authority) there muſt be allowed to be very great differences and unequal degrees of happineſs or miſery in thoſe two places or elſe neither the Juſtice of God nor the different Caſes of Men can be accounted for with any tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eaſe and ſatisfaction to our thoughts or be any way reconciled to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples either of Reaſon or Religion.</p>
                  <p>God the Juſt and All-knowing Judge will give all allowances to the hard circumſtances, the invincible igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, the unavoidable failures, the powerful temptations, the particular caſes and ſeveral diſadvantages that any of Mankind have been under, and with the faireſt and moſt impartial equity will adjudge all their Conditions and proportion their future Rewards and Puniſhments according to what is due to them, <hi>all things conſidered,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the right or wrong uſe of that
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:103342:232"/>freedom and liberty which he gave them and the faults or vertues under that light and knowledge they had, of their own wills and choices, by which alone they can either be or be denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated good or bad Men; Some of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſeem not to have either vertues enough to qualifie them for Heaven or to be ſo wilfully vitious as to deſerve Hell, but to be in a kind of middle ſtate here between Vertue and Vice whatever they ſhall be in hereafter, and many who are guilty of ſome Vices which the Scripture declares damnable and exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of Heaven yet are not of ſuch downright Irreligion and General Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligacy and Debauchery as others, Thus alſo many have ſome real ſenſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion but yet are but weakly moved and influenced by it and do but juſt live in a very low way of Grace and Vertue and are not ſo Rich in good works nor do ſo abound in Acts of Piety, Zeal, Uſefulneſs and Charity as others. Therefore one Equal Complete Perfect Entire State either of Happineſs or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery cannot belong to all theſe alike, but Heaven or Hell are proportionable unequal different conditions of both
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:103342:232"/>exactly ſuited and fitted to the Moral and Religious Deſerts, Capacities and Qualifications of all Rational Beings in which they ſhall be fixt to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity without alteration, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not without further improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and gradual riſings and fallings, according to the Nature of either of thoſe States.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Thoughts have been a great eaſe and ſatisfaction to my ſelf in the Conception of the great and amazing things of another World; and I therefore communicate them not only on the fore-mentioned account, but becauſe they may be ſo to others who conſider thoſe greateſt Objects of Meditation with any penetration of thought, according to the beſt helps we have of Philoſophy and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and I am perſwaded it would be good Service to Religion if it were thus fairly reconciled in all the revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Truths and Articles of it to the thoughts of inquiſitive Men as I doubt not but it may be, but this is a ſubject of another Nature which I am not now to meddle withal.</p>

               <p>I Shall now conſider the Particular Exerciſe of Repentance taken as a ſingle Duty diſtinct from all others of Obedience, which are in the largeſt ſenſe involved in it, and without which it is not effectual to Pardon and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as I have all along ſhown; but Repentance taken ſingly for a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar act of a Sinner juſt ſtruck and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with a ſenſe of his Sins, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing at ſet times Penitential Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and proper Actions upon the thoughts and remembrance of them; this which is often called Repentance, and is ſo in ſome ſenſe, but not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to compleat this Duty and to entitle us to all the effects of Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance as they are promiſed to it in Scripture, in a more large and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive Notion, as including a

<pb n="444" facs="tcp:103342:234"/>of it lay in theſe but in Reformation of Heart and Life, Converſion and Obedience to God; but theſe are the buds and bloſſoms of thoſe fruits of Repentance, the ſeeds and the ſigns of it, or at leaſt the outward concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants and attendants of it, and ſuch a retinue as are proper to go along with it, for the ſolemnity at leaſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent performance of it if not as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to the thing it ſelf. Neceſſary generally in private but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in publick Acts or Expreſſions of Repentance, wherein a publick reparation and ſatisfaction is to be given to Gods Honour and Authority, his Judgments to be averted and his Anger deprecated, and a common ſenſe and apprehenſion of all this to be promoted and inculcated among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as in publick Penances and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Repentances, and therefore we read chiefly of theſe upon ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, both in Scripture and Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Writers. Open Sins are a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honouring of God, an affronting and deſpiſing his Power and Authority, a ſetting up our Wills againſt his, a gratifying and indulging our ſelves in undue liberties and unlawful inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:103342:234"/>of Body: Now 'tis fit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in our Repentance for them wherein we make what amends we can to God and repair the injury we have done him, and undo the Sin as far as we are able, and ſhow our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt diſpleaſure againſt it, that we ſhould fall down before him and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it, and be ſorry for it, and humble our ſelves to him, and own our vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and wretchedneſs and unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and expreſs the deepeſt reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it, and ſhow our anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our ſelves, and revenge it very ſeverely, and afflict our Souls and our Bodies with ſomething that ſhall not be very grateful to them, nor pleaſant and acceptable to our Senſes.</p>
               <p>The deſign of all this is to beget in our Mind ſuch thoughts of our Sins, and ſuch paſſions and averſations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, or at leaſt to let thoſe inward thoughts and paſſions which are ſuppoſed to ariſe in it from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon them to have ſuch out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vent and expreſſions as Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally belong to them, and as other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of grief and trouble are apt to excite in them; for without thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thoughts and paſſions which are
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:103342:235"/>the ſprings of theſe outward actions they are all but feigned and hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, and ſo a mocking of God who knows the Heart; and then theſe outward penitences are like rains and ſhowers to make the ſprings riſe higher, and to feed and increaſe thoſe inward averſions and paſſions and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſures againſt our Sins; and thus they are inſtruments and helps to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Repentance as well as acts and exerciſes of it: But I ſhall conſider them all ſingly, and the particular Rules belonging to each of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then Confeſſion of Sins is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary part of this Repentance; <hi>If we confeſs our ſins God is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. <hi>i. e.</hi> this Confeſſion with its due ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects will procure forgiveneſs, as 'tis <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. <hi>He that confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſin ſhall have mercy.</hi> This is very neceſſary and fit to be obſerved concerning Repentance, and other Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in Scripture, as Faith and the like, that when Pardon or Salvation is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed or aſcribed to any of them, they are to be taken not ſingly and by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves but with all their conſequences and effects, ſo that 'tis a <hi>Metonymy</hi>
                  <pb n="447" facs="tcp:103342:235"/>of a part for the whole, when it is ſaid, <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved; i. e.</hi> he that believeth and obeyeth the Goſpel; and he that <hi>repenteth</hi> or he that <hi>confeſſeth</hi> his Sin <hi>ſhall be forgiven, i. e.</hi> if he ſo repent of it or confeſs it as to forſake and amend it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though the Goſpel promiſes often Bleſſedneſs to ſingle Vertues, as in our Saviours Sermon on the Mount, yet it means to thoſe Vertues joyned with the others, and not ſeparate from them, for they are all neceſſary to our true Bleſſedneſs; and when ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Duties have the promiſe of Salvation 'tis in conjunction with all the reſt, for univerſal Obedience to all the Laws of the Goſpel is the only full Condition of our Salvation, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Faith or Repentance or any one ſingle Vertue or Duty without <hi>that</hi> will make us happy or ſave us, as is plain by the whole tenour of it, which yet ſome are not ſo willing to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</p>
               <p>This Confeſſion of Sin which is the firſt part of Repentance to owne we have done amiſs, is an acknowledging the folly and evil of our Sins, that we are ſenſible they were acts of impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:103342:236"/>as to our ſelves, of unbecoming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unworthineſs to God, and very impudent breaches and violations of the Laws of Heaven, for our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions are not to inſtruct God or to inform him of what he already knows as well as our ſelves, nor is he pleaſed with a long roll or catalogue of our Sins recited before him, but they are Inditements brought againſt our ſelves, a charge and pleading guilty upon it of our many Treaſons and Miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours againſt Heaven, and the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or repeating of it is to ſtrike us with an inward ſenſe of the ſad and dreadful ſtate we are in by reaſon of them, and how like notorious Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals we ſtand convicted by our own Conſciences, and condemned by our own Confeſſion, and ſo without infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Mercy juſtly obnoxious to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt Puniſhment and Judgment of God. Our Confeſſion is to quicken and enliven and ſtrike the ſenſe of our Sins more deeply and keenly into our Souls, to make our Hearts bleed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh upon every remembrance of them, and to renew the Paſſions of Grief and Trouble upon the thoughts of them. Like thoſe who brought
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:103342:236"/>
                  <hi>Caeſars</hi> bloody Coat into the <hi>Forum,</hi> and ſhewed the People the holes thro' which his Murderers had ſtab'd him, that ſo they might move their higheſt rage and indignation; ſo we are to ſet our Sins before us that ſo we may ſtir up our anger and hatred and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure the more highly againſt them.</p>
               <p>Though they are never ſo long paſt yet we ſhould remember them with bitterneſs, and ſigh whenever we think of them, and whatever brings them to our Mind ſhould bring ſuch Paſſions along with them as ſhow we do not like them, nor are pleaſed with them. When they riſe up in our Conſciences or our Memories it ſhould be <hi>cum ructu acido,</hi> with a ſowerneſs and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as things moſt unagreeable and offenſive to us, and our Confeſſion ſhould be a diſcharging and caſting them from us.</p>
               <p>The Soul may be loaded and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt with them till it has thus eaſed it ſelf by Confeſſion, which may be like lancing an Ulcer, letting out the painful and purulent matter, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open the Wound in order to the healing of it. We ought to ſearch
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:103342:237"/>our Hearts and Conſciences to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and to own and confeſs all our Sins, that ſo we may be duly affected with the grievouſneſs of them, and may excite ſuch penitential reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as are fit often to be ſtirred up in our Souls. He that is ſenſleſs and ſtupified under his Sins is in a grievous and lamentable caſe. The Soul is then under the height of the Diſeaſe, and has the moſt incurable Symptoms up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it when 'tis thus under a Spiritual Lethargy, and its ill Habit and Craſis is like to bring it to an Apoplexy of which it will dye more certainly and unavoidably. If it be poſſible it muſt be brought to pain in order to cure it, and the moſt ſmarting Remedies muſt be uſed to awaken it and bring it to it ſelf; it muſt be burn'd and cup'd and ſcarified to bring ſome feeling to its ſeared Conſcience, and the ſharp ſting of its Sins muſt prick it to the quick to make its brawny and callous Heart have any ſenſe of them. They muſt therefore be offered to its thoughts and memory with all their aggravations and bitter circumſtances, and the moſt rouzing and awakening reflections and conſiderations. And this is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:103342:237"/>of Confeſſion, to keep a lively and quick and due ſenſe of our mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Sins upon our Minds, that we neither forget them nor become inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of them.</p>
               <p>God will not forget them nor does he need to be reminded of them, but we muſt remind our ſelves and ſay with <hi>David, My ſin is ever before me, Pſal.</hi> 51.3. and <hi>mine iniquity have I not hid, Pſal.</hi> 32.5. that is, not from my ſelf and my own thoughts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, for to hide it from God is impoſſible, but I will alwayes have a ſorrowful ſenſe and bitter remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is to be joyned with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſorrow and contrition, and with our outward weeping and lamenting, as <hi>Peter</hi> upon denying his Maſter <hi>went out and wept bitterly, Matth.</hi> 26. and his Penitents in the Acts <hi>were pricked to the heart, Acts</hi> 2.37. and were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great ſorrow and compunction of Mind, and <hi>David watered his couch with his tears, Pſal.</hi> 6.6. and <hi>rivers of water run down his eyes, Pſal.</hi> 119.136. And the Scripture deſcribes Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance by a <hi>broken and a contrite heart, Pſal.</hi> 51.17. in oppoſition to a hard
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:103342:238"/>and impenitent one. All Penitents are drawn with a ſad and mournful look, with tears in their eyes and ſorrow in their hearts, ſmiting their breaſts and wringing their hands, and all the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of Grief and Lamentation, and covered with a veil of ſadneſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolateneſs. For Grief and Sorrow are Paſſions of Soul upon the preſence of any evil that is afflicting and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie to us; and Sin being the greateſt of thoſe evils ſhould cauſe the higheſt of thoſe paſſions, and we have more reaſon to be ſorry and lament for it than a Widow over her loſt Husband, or a Mother over her firſt-born that is dead, or a Friend over another that is murthered ruined and undone; for our Souls ought to be dearer to us than any thing elſe, and Sin kills, ruins and murthers them. But here I muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe a Caution; Sin is a Spiritual Evil, and works not upon our Bodily Paſſions ſo ſtrongly and deeply as thoſe other objects may which are more ſuited to them, and more fit to excite ſuch animal ſenſations and impreſſions as Naturally riſe from them. Thus ſenſible Beauty may charm our Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits more than the Intellectual
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:103342:238"/>Pulchritude of Vertue and Muſick may more raviſh us than the harmony of Reaſon, or then the thoughts of the Heavenly ſinging and Hallelujah; and theſe and the taſts of ſome ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible dainties may more affect us with a ſenſible pleaſure than the very joyes and pleaſures of Heaven as we can now conceive them, for they are more ſuited to our Animal Nature, and more agreeable to the mixt Faculties ariſing from the union of our Souls and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and ſo there may be more pain and ſorrow felt for a Wound in a Mans Body than for a Sin in his Soul, and more tears ſhed for the misfortune of a Friend or the loſs of a Child or a near Relation than for the miſcarriage of our Lives or the commiſſion of a Sin, for the one is a ſorrow of another nature and another kind, raiſed not by Senſe but by Reaſon, not Natural but Religious, not from Mechaniſm of Body but Conſideration of Mind, and therefore the greatneſs or the ſincerity of our Repentance is not to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by the quantity of our Tears, or the number of our Sighs, or the degrees alwayes of Animal Sorrow, but rather by the ſincerity of our Wills
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:103342:239"/>and the actual performance of our good Purpoſes of forſaking and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Sins, which are the only ſure marks of our diſliking them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſorry for them, and having a true hatred and averſion to them; for thoſe ſecret and inward Paſſions of Mind are not to be known often either by our ſelves or others but by the effects, and we can only know we love Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and hate Sin by following the one, and forſaking the other; for no Man loves a thing heartily but if it be in his power he will attain it, and no Man otherwiſe loves Vertue or Heaven: No Man hates any thing or is heartily ſorry for any evil, but if it be in his power he will remove it if preſent, and avoid it if abſent. No Man can know he has the <hi>love of God</hi> but by this in which the Scripture places it, by <hi>keeping his Commandments,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.3. and therefore I am afraid that School diſtinction between Contrition and Attrition, that the one is a Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row from the Love of God, and the other from the Fear of Hell, and ſo the one is ſufficient, and the other is not has little or nothing in it but words, by which Men may eaſily cheat and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:103342:239"/>themſelves; for the ſecret ſprings and principles of Mens Paſſions lye too deep to be diſcerned, and they run into one another and are ſo mixt and confounded that they cannot be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed, neither is there any great difference between them, and only the effects of them are taken notice of in the account of God and the concerns of Religion. It is a meer Nicety to diſtinguiſh ſuch Principles in the firſt forming of Repentance, like looking for the colours of Flowers or taſte of Fruit in the ſeveral Seeds of them, whereas he that from true Religious Principles, be they either Love Hope or Fear, (and they generally are mixt and combined together, and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not divide the force or weight of each of them ſeverally upon the Mind) whoever I ſay from theſe, or any or all of theſe is ſo concerned for his paſt Sins that he leaves them and forſakes them and becomes a good Man he has undoubtedly true Repentance; and whatever the Principle of it was, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Love or Fear, and whatever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree there was in the ſorrow and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and concern for it, it is that fruit and effect and permanent iſſue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:103342:240"/>of it that conſtitutes and denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates it true and perfect Repentance.</p>
               <p>Let not therefore any Man doubt his Repentance who has this evidence and demonſtration of it, and let no Man deceive himſelf without this, and think that the Keys of the Church any thing the Miniſter can do for him, or any thing that Chriſt has done for him, or the Merit of his Blood, or any Free-Grace, or any Faith in him, or any thing that a deluded and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Sinner is willing to catch hold off, can turn his Sorrow be it never ſo great, and be it from what Principle ſoever either of Love or Fear, into perfect and ſufficient Repentance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the effect of Reformation and a good Life, and performing the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Goſpel neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Godly Sorrow is an excellent means and a good beginning of Repentance; 'tis ſowing in tears thoſe ſeeds of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which may grow up to matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of goodneſs and amendment of Life, and if thoſe penitential tears waſh away the filth of our Sins, and <hi>cleanſe the hands and purifie the heart</hi> of a Sinner, they are then true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:103342:240"/>If the Salt that is in them eat out our Corruption and preſerve us from all impurities afterwards, and the bitterneſs of the Sorrow makes us diſreliſh and diſlike our Sins ever after, and wean and turn away our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from them; and like the Waters of <hi>Siloam</hi> work upon us and perform the Cure, when they are thus ſtirred and impregnated with a Divine Vertue by the moving of Heaven upon them, then they are of great Vertue, and ought to be frequently uſed and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd and indulged as they were of old for this purpoſe by the devout and tender Penitents: But all Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons can no more weep and ſhed tears alike than they can make the Hairs of their Head white or black; and tho' all ſhould be ſorry for their Sins, as being convinced in their Minds of the evil of them, yet the paſſionate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and the outward expreſſions of this Sorrow fall not under any rules or meaſures, but are beſt judged and known by the effect, which is leaving them as what we do not like but hate. Without this our Tears run waſt, and our Sorrow is but as an empty Cloud, or Rain upon barren Ground without
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:103342:241"/>any Fruit, and all our bitter Cryes and Lamentations are but as the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the <hi>Epheſian</hi> Matron when we can ſtrike up again immediately with our Sins, and take the cauſes of our Sorrow and the murderers of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Joy immediately into our Hearts and our Embraces.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Humiliations, Bodily Auſterities and Mortifications, and eſpecially Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, make up this Duty of Penitence or Exerciſe of Repentance. For thus the Penitents of old put on Sackcloth and ſpread Aſhes upon their Heads, lay proſtrate upon the ground and rent their Clothes in the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Countries, and faſted and denyed themſelves their ordinary Food, and afflicted their Souls with theſe ſeverities upon their Bodies. For Sin being committed chiefly by the Body, as not only the Inſtrument but the Tempter to it, and the Fleſh and its Carnal gratifications being the ſtrongeſt and commoneſt allurements to it, therefore to ſhow their anger and diſpleaſure againſt it, they revenged it upon their Bodies, and chaſtized thoſe <hi>ſervants of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> and uſed ſuch a diſcipline up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as might puniſh them for
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:103342:241"/>what was paſt and be a means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their ſinning for the future: And to ſhow the ſenſe they had of their own vileneſs and unworthineſs for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving offended God, they expreſt and teſtified it by all acts of humiliation and lowly ſubmiſſion to his Power and Greatneſs which they had formerly oppoſed, withſtood and diſobeyed Now theſe Acts or Exerciſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance were ſo acceptable to God, when they were the ſigns and effects of a true penitent Heart, that we find in Scripture how it prevailed with God ſo far to pardon Sin as to remove the Temporal Judgments he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt it. Thus <hi>Niniveh</hi> was ſaved from deſtruction, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3. when <hi>they proclaimed a faſt and put on ſackcloth, and decreed that neither man nor beaſt ſhould taſte any thing, but be covered with ſackcloth and aſhes,</hi> ver. 7.8. And <hi>Joſiah</hi> when he thus hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelf and rent his Clothes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his hearing the deſtruction of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> denounced by the Propheteſs, had it defer'd till after his Death, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.19 And even wicked <hi>Ahab</hi> had Gods Judgment reſpited and took off from himſelf, becauſe when
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:103342:242"/>he heard it, <hi>He rent his clothes and put ſackcloth upon his fleſh and faſted,</hi> 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 21.27. God himſelf aſſigning this as a Reaſon to the Prophet, <hi>Seeſt thou how Ahab humbleth himſelf before me, becauſe he humbleth himſelf before me I will not bring the evil in his days, ver.</hi> 29. And we find theſe Acts of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation and this Diſcipline of Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joyned with Repentance not only in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church but alſo in the Chriſtian, in the firſt and beſt Ages when this Penitential Diſcipline was moſt ſtrictly obſerved by all Penitents. Now the Queſtion is,
<list>
                     <item>1. Whether theſe are neceſſary as proper acts or parts of Repentance, or whether internal Repentance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe outward Exerciſes of it may not be ſufficient?</item>
                     <item>2. Whether if they be not neceſſary they are not uſeful and proper to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote or at leaſt to expreſs it?</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Now as to the firſt Queſtion, The neceſſity of theſe we muſt make a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between publick and private Repentance.</p>
               <p>In publick Repentance, as that of a Nation or City when they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move or avert a Judgment, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precate
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:103342:242"/>Gods Anger due to their Sins, and exerciſe a ſolemn and publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for them, this ought to be done by outward Humiliations and Faſtings, and ſuch ſigns and expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as are proper and uſual to teſtifie great concern and trouble and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and humiliation, that ſo they may make the beſt acknowledgment and ſatisfaction to God for their Sins, and the beſt reparation to his injured Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Authority, and may beget in others, and propagate over the whole Kingdom or Nation the ſame penitential ſenſe and concern for their Sins, in order to avoid the danger and the judgment due upon them. And thus in the publick Exerciſes of Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in the Chriſtian Church when any had by a notorious and ſcandalous Sin brought a reproach and infamy upon the Church and their Religion, the Governours were concerned for its Honour and Credit to take notice and turn them out of their Communion, and put them in a ſtate of publick Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence for their grievous faults. And here it was neceſſary for ſuch Perſons to ſatisfie the Church by their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Acts of Repentance, Mourning
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:103342:243"/>and humiliation that they were truly and inwardly penitent and were likely to live better and become other Men before they received them again into their Communion, and this though it was but a Prudential Method and an External Diſcipline of the Church yet was excellently fitted for the reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reforming great and open Offenders, by thus ſhaming them out of their ſins and keeping the Rod over them and ſhutting them out of the Church by the power of the Keys till they were fit to be admitted and received in again upon the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſigns of a True Repentance, and this our Church has good reaſon to wiſh for again and ought to reſtore it, did not the ſtate and circumſtances we are in unavoidably hinder it, but it is utterly impracticable under great Schiſms and Diviſions from the Church and great Looſeneſs and Contempt of Religion, which make it impoſſible for the Church to exerciſe this Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline which were otherwiſe its Duty, but this is at moſt but an Uſeful Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline not a neceſſary or Eſſential part of Repentance to go through thoſe peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential courſes of Humiliation and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:103342:243"/>which the ancient Penitents did, all that is ſtrictly neceſſary and all that the Scripture commands as a duty is an Internal Penitence towards God tranſacted between him and our own Souls wherein we humble our ſelves before him under a ſenſe of our own vileneſs and unworthineſs and with the greateſt ſubmiſſion of our Souls bow down our ſelves, and own his Power and Right to puniſh us and beſeech him for Chriſt's ſake not to uſe it <hi>i. e.</hi> to pardon and forgive us; Now this I doubt not with ſincerity of mind at preſent and Amendment of Life af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards is a ſufficient Exerciſe of this Duty to private and particular perſons without all the other Solemnities and performaces of a publick Penitence, for the deſign of thoſe is hereby fully attained as to the Perſon himſelf which was to amend him and to recover him and to make him more careful not to offend for the future by his ſhame and ſufferings for what is paſt.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has turned this Diſcipline of Publick Penitence uſed in the Primitive Church into Auricular Confeſſion and Private Penance which
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:103342:244"/>beſides the folly of giving Abſolution firſt and ſuppoſing ſome of the guilt and puniſhment remaining after the Sin is pardoned, and making the Eternal Puniſhment eaſier to be got off than than the Temporal, and impoſing tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling and ridiculous penances and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them properly ſatisfactory, is a ſhameful corrupting an antient Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and uſing the Keys of the Church only to unlock the Conſciences firſt, and then the Purſes of the Laity, and is a wretched Corruption of the true Notion of Repentance by making it a light and tranſient thing, and that the leaſt degree of Sorrow by the Power of the Keys is ſufficient for Pardon and Salvation.</p>
               <p>From them I doubt not came the firſt looſe and wretched Miſtakes about Repentance, and theſe being joyned with the falſe and unwary Doctrines of others about Juſtifying and Saving Faith, its being a mere fiduciary Rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon Chriſt and his Merits, and that we were to be ſaved by the free Grace of the Goſpel without Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to its Commands or Performing its Conditions and that God's Grace was ſo powerful and miraculous in the
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:103342:244"/>Converſion of a Sinner that it did its work Inſtantaneouſly and Irreſiſtibly, theſe hindred Men from performing that Duty, that true Repentance and Obedience which they thought upon ſome accounts not ſo neceſſary, or that they expected could be done for them in an inſtant, and ſo they need not trouble themſelves about it all their lives, by theſe Reſerves and falſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and comfortable as they call 'em, but deceitful Doctrines they ſhifted off the difficult task of leaving all their Sins and leading a good life which otherwiſe muſt be owned to be the only true way to Salvation and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and when this appears clearly to us as it will if we rightly underſtand Religion, nothing but downright A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm and disbelieving it will hinder the Power and Efficacy of it upon our lives.</p>
               <p>But as to the Uſefulneſs of thoſe Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitential Auſterities and Mortifications and Acts of Humiliation though pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Repentance may be without them yet they may be of ſome good Uſe and Advantage both as means to promote it and as ſigns fit to expreſs it, Thus faſting eſpecially and abſtinence from
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:103342:245"/>food is a proper way both of <hi>afflicting the Soul</hi> and of <hi>bringing the body into ſubjection,</hi> and as feaſting in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing is improper for one Sorrowing, Mourning, and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as we ought often to be upon ſerious and ſad Reflections made upon our Sins, ſo for many Sins pampering and indulging the Carkaſs, is adding fuel to them, and to abate and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract from our Meat and drink is to cut off thoſe Recruits and Nouriſhments which uſually <hi>make proviſion for the fleſh, and maintain the luſts thereof,</hi> Now then private prudence and diſcretion will adviſe every good Man to make uſe of that which he finds may be ſo uſeful and inſtrumental to the purpoſes of Vertue, and to the deſigns of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but to enjoyn it further, and lay an abſolute neceſſity of it to all Perſons and Tempers as of Prayer, giving Alms and other Chriſtian Duties this is more than either the Church or the Scripture does ever warrant, I ſpeak as to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Repentance which is effectual to every Mans Pardon and Salvation, as to publick, ſuch as the Publick Faſts commanded by Authority either in the Jewiſh or Chriſtian Church, there the
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:103342:245"/>Nature of the thing and Obedience to thoſe who were lawful Governours made it a Duty to comply with their Religious Commands and Deſigns and to Expreſs our Publick and Solemne Repentance by ſuch ſigns as are fit and uſual on ſuch an occaſion, and not to keep a Feſtival when our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and our Chriſtian Neighbours and our Sins and the fear of ſome Judgment call upon us for Faſting and Humiliation, but bow long we are then to faſt and whether to eat nothing till the Evening, and what kind of Meat, is what our Health and Conſtitution and a little degree of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence joyned with a good ſenſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion will direct us in without a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor; He is a Slave to his Appetite, and makes a God of his Belly who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny himſelf a meal now and then upon ſuch an account, and he is a weak and Superſtitious Creature who thinks Religion lies in ſome ſtrict and little niceties of performing this without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his Health and the more true and proper deſigns of it.</p>
               <p>Faſting has been alwayes obſerved by Devout and Pious Penitents in all Ages as an Exerciſe of penitence and a
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:103342:246"/>help to Devotion and Religion, and Lent or the Antepaſchal Faſt is eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of great Uſage and Antiquity in the Chriſtian Church but not obſerved alike in all places as is plain from <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and others, but it was chiefly deſigned for Publick Penitence of noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Sinners who were to be reſtored to the Communion of the Church and Receiving the Sacrament at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> but it may be of good Uſe to the private Repentance of every particular Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian who ought to ſet aſide ſome time for the Examining of himſelf and the Reflecting upon his paſt Sins and as long as he lives he ought to Exerciſe a particular Repentance for all the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sins he ever committed, and to have ſome appointed times to offer up the Sacrifice of a broken and contrite heart and to let his heart bleed afreſh and pierce it ſelf very deeply with the remembrance of its paſt Sins, which though God has forgotten ſo as not to puniſh yet he ought never to forget ſo as not to Repent of them.</p>
               <p>I mention not other Bodily penances ſuch as putting on Sackcloth and Aſhes which were <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Modes of Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:103342:246"/>but do no more oblige us than rending our Garments and pouring out Water which were uſed by them, and as to whipping and going bare-foot which one calls the penance of a Gooſe, Some of thoſe which are in uſe in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church are rather Heatheniſh than Chriſtian Cuſtoms, like <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts Cutting and Lancing themſelves and they are no more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Cure Men of their Sins, or be Helps to Repentance than the taking a Purge or Vomit, which would work as effectually upon their Minds and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel their Vices and Corruptions as well as any of thoſe Penitential Rods and Diſciplines upon the backs of Fools who underſtand not what true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is.</p>
               <p>All ſuch Bodily Exerciſe profiteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the freeing from their ſins but is only a commuting with God for them and makes them believe that repentance lyes only in ſuch an <hi>opus operatum</hi> which however ſevere it ſeems yet is much eaſier than to leave their Sins and their beloved Luſts, as we find many of our Lovers of Wine rather chooſe to take Phyſick now and then to cure their
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:103342:247"/>Head-ach than to become ſober which would do it much better.</p>
               <p>But true Repentance is not to be known or judged of by ſuch unnatural follies which they call the fruits but are not ſo much as the ſhadows of true Repentance, nor by any of theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Symptoms or Acts of Penitence which are the moſt proper Exerciſes or Attendants of it but by the Change wrought upon our Hearts and Lives and the Effectual Amendment and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of both, as we are to judge of the Soundneſs and Goodneſs of our Health not by the ſtrength or bitterneſs of the Phyſick we took in order to it, or by the Ragimen and Rules we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in taking it though they might be neceſſary and of good uſe, nor by its manner of working upon us but by the effect of it which is its Curing us, when that is done by whatever wayes it was ſo the work is done and the end attained, and till it be, nothing is done to any purpoſe, which brings me to the laſt head of Diſcourſe, Namely the Marks and Signs of True Repentance.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> How we may know we have Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and are in a Pardoned and Good State.</head>
               <p>NOthing is of greater importance to us than to make a right judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſelves as to our Spiritual State, to know whether we are in a State of Grace and Pardon with God, whether our Condition be ſuch that we may reaſonably hope we are in his Favour at preſent, and have a Title to Heaven and Happineſs hereafter. No Man that believes Religion, and is not perfectly thoughtleſs and ſtupid, but muſt upon the account of theſe things have the greateſt Peace and Comfort of Mind or the greateſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs and diſturbance: For nothing is ſo great an object of our Hopes and Fears, and does ſo highly affect us as theſe will or ought to do. No Man ſhould one would think, enjoy himſelf one moment, or be at quiet in his
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:103342:248"/>thoughts who is in a ſtate of enmity with the great God, and lives under his anger and diſpleaſure, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he may eſcape here yet lyes under the dread and terrour and amazing danger of another World.</p>
               <p>To know and examine and be able to judge of this ſhould one would think be very plain, becauſe the Rule is ſo by which we are to judge our ſelves, and by which God will judge us. The Terms and Conditions of our Salvation are laid down very clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Scripture, ſincere and conſtant Obedience to Gods Laws, or where we fail of performing that, true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which is to be in the place, and will be accepted inſtead of Perfect Obedience. But many are willing to cheat themſelves, and be deluded with falſe hopes and miſtaken grounds of Comfort, and to ſay, <hi>Peace, Peace, where there is no Peace,</hi> and to deceive themſelves with falſe marks and ſigns of Grace, and without any good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe themſelves to have an Intereſt in Chriſt and be the Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of Heaven.</p>
               <p>There were ſome in the Apoſtles time as well as ours who had this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:103342:248"/>of themſelves, and made great pretences to the moſt myſterious knowledge (calling themſelves <hi>Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks</hi>) and to the moſt intimate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Heaven, and to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of the higheſt form and order, who yet wallowed in all manner of Wickedneſs, and lived in very great Sins and unlawful Liberties expreſly forbidden by the Goſpel. They abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſome of the Doctrines of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and perverted the very Deſign and Conſtitution of it, and by making a falſe Scheme of it to themſelves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered its Nature, turning it like our latter <hi>Antinomians</hi> into a mere No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Superſtition inſtead of an Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Vertue and Holineſs, and judged of themſelves not by its Rules and ſtanding Terms and Conditions, but by ſome ungrounded and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Priviledges that no way belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them. St. <hi>John</hi> in his firſt Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle layes down ſeveral Cautions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch as theſe, and warns the Chriſtians to beware of their looſe and pernicious though pretendedly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrines, ſuch as St. <hi>James</hi> alſo ſpeaks very openly againſt when he corrects their miſtakes who would be
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:103342:249"/>
                  <hi>juſtified by faith without works, i. e.</hi> put into a Righteous and Good State by Chriſtianity without Obedience and Vertue. <hi>Little Children,</hi> ſayes St. <hi>John, let no man deceive you, he that doth righteouſneſs is righteous even as he is righteous,</hi> 1 John 3.7. <hi>He that committeth ſin is of the Devil,</hi> ver. 8. <hi>Whoſoever is born of God doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſin,</hi> ver. 9. <hi>In this the children of God are manifeſt and the children of the Devil,</hi> ver. 10. Where in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to all the falſe Opinions by which thoſe wicked Men believed themſelves in a good State, notwithſtanding their Wickedneſs or their not being Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and made falſe marks and ſigns of Grace to themſelves, and account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves the ſpecial Favourites of God and of Chriſt by ſome conceited and peculiar Priviledges, though they were wicked and impenitent, and liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ſtate of plain and notorious Sin, he layes down a clear and certain, a plain and obvious Mark and Crite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion by which we may judge of our ſelves, and by which alone we can judge aright of our Spiritual Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and know whether we are in a Pardoned and Good State, and that is
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:103342:249"/>this, that <hi>we do not commit ſin,</hi> or live in the practice of any known and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sin whatſoever, till we bring our ſelves to this, we can never by any means whatever, by any priviledge of Chriſtianity, or by all that Chriſt has or could do for us, be free from a ſtate of guilt and danger, till we get rid of every Sin and break off every evil way, then we ſhall recover our good State however dangerous and deplorable it was before, and ſhall be as ſure of Gods Favour and a Title to Heaven as if we had been alwayes innocent, and never had ſinned. Many are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to judge of themſelves by ſome other and kinder meaſures, and are willing to believe well of themſelves, and hope they have an Intereſt in Chriſt, and a Title to Gods Favour and hopes of Heaven without leaving every Sin, and living ſuch a ſtrict and holy Life as the Goſpel requires, they have ſome Reſerves, and ſome falſe Notions and Principles in Religion whereby they comfort themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this ſevere Doctrine, and think by ſome way or other to reconcile their Sins with the hopes of Heaven and their Eternal Salvation. There
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:103342:250"/>have been other Schemes of Religion laid down, and ſuch Whimſical Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſes made of it by ſome Men, from the unwary ſtating and miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the Scripture Notions of Election, Juſtification, Faith, Free-Grace, and the like, that they at laſt come to aſſert theſe comfortable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines as they call them to a Sinner, and ſo they were if they were true, that their Sins can do them no harm, nor endanger their Salvation, and that Sanctification and Holineſs is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as the way or means to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and that a Sinner may come to Chriſt, and be Juſtified by him, and put in a good State before he Repents, even with all his Sins and Filth about him, which are ſo far from being Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and Goſpel Truths, as they are lewdly and ignorantly called, that they are certainly the moſt damnable Hereſies, and the moſt contrary and deſtructive to Chriſtianity that ever were in the World. I am not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into any Controverſies here, nor ſhow the Miſtakes too many run into about thoſe matters, all thoſe falſe and abominable Principles will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and all falſe Judgments and
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:103342:250"/>wrong Opinions of our ſelves and our Spiritual State taken away and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by this undoubted Mark and Criterion of our being in a good State or a State of Grace, which is the ſureſt Touchſtone by which every Chriſtian may ſafely try himſelf, and every Sinner know whether he is in a Pardoned and good State, namely, that they do not live in any known and wilful Sin whatever.

                  <p>TO ſhow this Mark given by the Apoſtle to be the true Teſt and Criterion by which we may make Judgment of our Spiritual Condition and know we are in a good State, I ſhall offer theſe following Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to prove the Truth of it</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then, thoſe other Marks which come ſhort of this by which too many are apt to deceive themſelves are not ſafe and ſufficient. Many are apt to make ſome inward and ſecret things wrought upon their Minds the Marks of Grace to them, and the ſigns and evidences of their good State, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may be ſadly cheated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded unleſs theſe inward Marks are made more certain and evident by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and viſible Actions. None can know they have any inward Principle of Spiritual Life in their Souls, or the root of the matter in them, as ſome love to ſpeak, but by ſuch vital opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and viſible effects of it in their
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:103342:251"/>Lives; as we cannot know the Tree is alive at the root but by the ſprouts and branches that ſhoot from it and ſhow it to be ſo, but we conclude it to be dead without thoſe in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per time, and ſo we may our ſelves in a Spiritual ſenſe without the Fruits of Repentance and Holineſs in our Lives. A Chriſtian cannot know he hath Faith but by his Works, nor be ſure of Grace in the Heart but by the efficacy of it in reſtraining him from Sin and the viſible effects of it in a Holy Converſation. We cannot ſo perfectly feel and diſcern this ſecret and inward principle in our ſelves ſo as to be any way aſſured of it unleſs the force and power of it appear in our Actions, and in reforming and bettering our Lives, and to judge of our being in a ſtate of Grace any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe from any voice or teſtimony within, is very precarious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded and very liable to error and deluſion, for <hi>the Spirit bears witneſs</hi> to none but thoſe whoſe <hi>Conſciences</hi> at the ſame time bear witneſs that they are <hi>the children of God by not committing ſin,</hi> and it ſealeth none but thoſe who have <hi>this Mark,</hi> and bear the Marks
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:103342:252"/>of Vertue and Holineſs upon their Souls and in their Lives. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous and conceited Enthuſiaſt is very confident and aſſured of himſelf and his good ſtate, though he is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently guilty of very great and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Sins, and therefore he is forced to that lewd Principle that God ſees no Sin in his Children, and that he may be a Child of God notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe, whereas this according to St. <hi>John</hi> is the only Mark of a Child of God, <hi>that he doth not commit Sin.</hi> To pretend to inward Marks of Grace when we are guilty of ſinful Actions, is as if a Man ſhould judge himſelf to be ſound at Heart and healthful within when the Plague is broke out upon him, and the Spots appear and his Sores run, to talk then of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Pulſe and other ſecret and uncertain ſigns within himſelf, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he feels himſelf to be well, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent cheat and wretched deluſion, and ſo it is to judge of our Spiritual good State by any inward marks and tokens when our Lives are bad, and <hi>we commit Sin</hi> in the Apoſtles ſenſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> live in the practice of any wilful Wickedneſs. But further, there are other imperfect
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:103342:252"/>ſigns not quite ſo deceitful and Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick as theſe, by which many think they are in a good State though they are not brought off actually from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sin, as that they are troubled and concerned at their Sins, and commit them with great reluctancy and unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of Mind, ſo <hi>that they do the things which they would not,</hi> and that they often wiſh they were better, and have a mind to leave their Sins and ſome purpoſes to do ſo, though their Sins are ſo ſtrong and powerful that they ſtill prevail upon them, and they cannot wholly get rid of them, this they take to be good ſigns of Grace, that they have ſome good motions and ſtirrings in their Souls, ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and wiſhes, and this deſire of Grace they take to be Grace it ſelf, and though they do not the good they would, yet that they have ſome mind and inclination to do it. Now all this may be in ſuch as are truly Sinners and Unregenerate Perſons, that are ſtill in an impenitent ſtate and under the power and dominion of their Sins, but are not quite ſenſleſs and ſtupified, nor are come to what the Apoſtle calls a <hi>ſeared</hi> Conſcience, without
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:103342:253"/>ſenſe of their Sins, nor to a <hi>reprobate</hi> Mind void of all judgment about them, which is the utmoſt degree of profligate wickedneſs, till they are brought to thoſe, their Sins will be uneaſie to them, and fill them with trouble whenever they think and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon them, as they cannot avoid to do ſometimes, and they will feel ſharp twitches and vellications of Conſcience as long as they have any Conſcience remaining, and have not quite waſted and deſtroyed it, and worn off all the Natural ſenſe of Good and Evil upon their Minds, but if they will ſtill ſin notwithſtanding this, and will not hearken to the ſecret calls or loud clamours of their own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, but will ſtill follow their Luſts and Vices, and be drawn away by the ſtrong and alluring Temptations of them, all this Regret and Trouble which they ſometimes bring upon them is only a ſelf-conviction and ſelf-condemnation, and is ſo far from giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any abatement to their Sins that it adds this higheſt aggravation to them, that they are committed all the while againſt Conſcience and againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſe of their own Minds. And
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:103342:253"/>though now and then in a good mood and a melancholly fit when they are thus troubled for their Sins they have a mind to leave them, and come to ſome faint Wiſhes Purpoſes and Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions to do ſo, yet if theſe prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, and the next Temptation overcomes them, and they commit the Sin again when it is offered again and the company or the charms invite again to it, 'tis certain <hi>whoſoever</hi> thus <hi>committeth ſin is the ſervant of ſin,</hi> as our Saviour ſayes, <hi>John</hi> 8.34. and 'tis a ſign he is ſuch a ſlave to it and it hath got ſuch power over him that it leads him captive at its will, and is ſo far Maſter of him that he cannot throw it off notwithſtanding his frequent Wiſhes and imperfect Deſires that he could; but how ſhort all this is of Perfect Repentance, and therefore of putting us into a good State, I have ſhown more largely before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Scripture not only forbids every wilful Sin but excludes it out of Heaven, and declares that every wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sinner of what kind ſoever ſhall not enter into it, as <hi>neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor abuſers
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:103342:254"/>of themſelves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, nor extortioners, ſhall inherit the kingdom of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>i. e.</hi> whoever are to be denominated ſuch by the practice of their Lives and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of their Minds, by their living and dying in any of thoſe Sins whatſoever, or in any one of them. This is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adjudged by the Goſpel, which is the Rule God will judge us by at the laſt day, and by that Rule we may judge our ſelves now, and all other judgments of our ſelves are falſe and deceitful. Whatever Sinner finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the number of that black Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, may ſee his Name as it were in the dead Warrant, and nothing but timely Repentance and Amendment before he dyes can blot it out. The Sentence of Damnation is as poſitive and expreſs againſt all or any ſuch Sinners, as the Sentence of Death is againſt Treaſon or Felony by the Civil Law, and no hopes to eſcape the Knowledge or Juſtice of infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and infinite Power, and therefore whoever is caſt by any one ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditement and found guilty of any ſuch Capital and Mortal Crime can never
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:103342:254"/>eſcape before the Divine Tribunal, the proceſs of which is laid open to us by the Goſpel, and by that we ſhould judge our ſelves now as impartially as we know God will hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Reaſon of this is plain, namely, of Gods forbidding every wilful Sin upon pain of Damnation, and excluding every ſuch Sinner out of Heaven, for otherwiſe he could have forbidden no Sin, but muſt have laid open all his Laws to be broken and trampled on by the diſobedience and unrulineſs of his Creatures; for had he ſuffered every one of Mankind to live in impunity under any one wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful though ſingle Sin, ſuch as his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular inclination or his intereſt would moſt incline to, by this means he would have opened a gap for the breach of all his Laws, ſo that none of them ſhould have been duely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved but all of them broken by parts and by piecemeal by ſome Sinner or other, one would have choſen to have gratified his Revenge, another his Luſt, one would have wallowed in Drunkenneſs another have perſued his Gain by all the methods of Fraud and Unrighteouſneſs, and according as

                  <p n="4">4. One ſuch wilful Sin is ſuch an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front Contempt and Diſobedience to the Divine Authority in general as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves in it an Univerſal guilt and breach of the whole Law of God, thus St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that ſhall keep the whole law</hi> beſides <hi>and yet offend in one point is guilty of all, James</hi> 2.10. for this reaſon, <hi>for he that ſaid Do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit adultery, ſaid alſo, Do not kill, now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill thou art become a Tranſgreſſor of the law,</hi> ver. 11. i. e. the ſame Power and Authority of God gives Sanction to all his Laws, and 'tis a vertual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning and diſclaimer of that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to diſobey it and rebel againſt it and openly oppoſe it in any caſe, which he does who lives in any one
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:103342:255"/>known and wilful Sin and is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted an Enemy and Traytor to Heaven and puniſht as ſuch, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces its abſolute Power and Right to Govern him in all things and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts the whole foundation of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Submiſſion to it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. One ſuch wilful Sin or vile Luſt if it be ſuffered to prevail upon the Mind expels all true Principles of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Religion out of it or ſhows it to be devoy'd of any ſuch as being ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly inconſiſtent with them, for he that alloweth himſelf in any ſinful li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty or unlawful practice contrary to the plain Rules of Religion can never have a due and juſt ſenſe of that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Mind, nor be ſuppoſed in any other things to be governed by ſuch conſiderations of God and Heaven and Religion as are the true principles of all Vertue and Goodneſs, where thoſe are not in the heart, all ſeeming Acts of Vertue and Religion loſe their form and worth and excellency and are but the ſpurious Off-ſpring of Chance Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour or Intereſt, for he that does any good action or abſtains from any bad one out of Regard to Religion and the Conſiderations of God and another
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:103342:256"/>World would for the ſame reaſons act uniformly and not allow himſelf to live contrary to thoſe in any other inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces nor comply with the moſt darling luſt or ſtrongeſt temptation when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to thoſe, but if he does ſo in any caſe he may as well do it in others, for this ſhows that he is ſwayed and governed by ſome other Principles than thoſe of Religion; A ſenſe of Honour as 'tis call'd, or not doing a thing baſe and ſcandalous in the opinion of others, or a prudent Caution and Diſcretion in ſerving our preſent Intereſt, theſe may keep many Men from ſome Vices that would deſtroy their Credit or their preſent Advantage but if there be no other foundation for them, it is not Vertue and Religion, but only Art and Managery which may have its reward here, but will never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded in Heaven, and this is what ſome commonly mean by a Moral Man, but 'tis a miſtake, for this is only a Man of Conduct and Cunning, whereas Morality is founded upon true and certain and Eternal Principles and Reaſons of Vertue but he that acts not by thoſe nor any Principles of Religion will be a Knave for his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:103342:256"/>and a Secret Sinner for his Luſts and make his Conſcience give way as oft as there is occaſion to his Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience or Inclination, for in other ſins which the Cuſtom and Opinion of the World have not made ſo infamous or ſo diſadvantagious there he can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly guilty and break the plain Rules of Vertue and Religion; He that can do ſo by indulging himſelf in any wilful Sin as he corrupts and ſpoils all his other ſeeming Vertues by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them to be baſe born, and not to proceed from a Religious and Vertuous Stock, ſo he throws off all true Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Religion, and ſhows that he has no true Root or genuine Seed of it in his heart.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Such an one lyes open to all other Sins and may for the ſame reaſon commit any that he allows himſelf in one, when the mind is thus proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and debaucht by conſenting to any one particular unlawful Luſt, it would grow common to all others if it had the ſame temptation to invite and the ſame opportunity to commit them, and 'tis only for want of thoſe that it is not univerſally lewd and wicked, and given up to commit all
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:103342:257"/>uncleanneſs with greedineſs, what ſhould hinder or reſtrain him from all other Sins who gives way to any one plain and great one, if he were aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the like temptation in any other place he would yield to it and comply with it even in the groſſeſt manner, for he has loſt his guard and the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Vertue, and by ſuch a wide and open breach made in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience all other ſins might enter and the whole Legion take poſſeſſion of him, There can be no true Reaſon to preſerve him from any or from all ſins, who knowingly and wilfully allows himſelf in any one.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Any ſuch ſin is utterly inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with true ſincerity, and this we know is abſolutely neceſſary to our good ſtate though perfection of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is not, 'tis truely and commonly ſaid that God requires not abſolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of us but only true ſincerity becauſe the beſt Men cannot attain to the one and he muſt be a very bad one who hath not the other, but there is a <hi>perfection</hi> of <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>degrees,</hi> we are not bound to the higheſt degrees of every Vertue in order to a State of Grace and Goodneſs, but we are to
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:103342:257"/>have ſuch a perfection of parts as to performe every Duty and every Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue required of us and to be without every willful Sin contrary to the Divine Law, for leſs than this will not amount to true ſincerity that ſhall commend us to God and approve us to him who knows our hearts, for whilſt he ſees there any one ſin that we love more than we do him, which we prize and value above his favour and all that he can give us even Heaven it ſelf, he cannot think our hearts are upright towards him or that we ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely love him; for can he ſincerely love God who does any wilful thing that he knows is infinitely diſpleaſing to him? And can it be conſiſtent with the faithfulneſs and integrity of friendſhip to do the moſt injurious and the moſt diſobliging thing imaginable? Can he love his Prince or the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where he lives who endeavours in any thing to ſubvert and deſtroy that Authority by an open ſtanding out and breaking their Laws? There may be indeed a Perſonal Love to an Earthly Prince diſtinct from Obedience to his Laws, (and ſo ſome would have to God and Chriſt) for he may be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:103342:258"/>of receiving other Pledges and Teſtimonies of it and may be many other ways obliged by us, becauſe he may have a Diſtinct Intereſt or Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion different from his laws, but this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in God whoſe Laws are always agreeable to his Nature and the reſult of his own infinite Wiſdom and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and he can never be pleaſed with any that act contrary to them nor is capable of receiving any other grateful or acceptable thing from us but only Obedience to his Commands, ſo that by this only we that are his Creatures can oblige him, and teſtifie the ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Love to him, as St. <hi>John</hi> ſays, <hi>This is the love of God that we keep his commandments,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.3. There is no other certain ſign or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of our Loving God but obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and no ſign of Loving him <hi>with all our heart and ſoul and mind,</hi> but obeying him Univerſally, and not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding and ſharing out our Love to him and our ſins, and ſuffering any of our vile Luſts to be his Rivals and Competitors in our Affections; Whilſt we allow our ſelves in any known and wilful ſin we take part with that which is an Enemy to God, we har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:103342:258"/>and nouriſh a known Traytor to him in our breaſts and if we will not give it up we break with God and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare open Enmity againſt him, and will rather part with him and his friendſhip than part with a Paltry and a Vile Luſt, whilſt we thus indulge any darling Sin and ſecret Wickedneſs in our heart as God cannot love us ſo neither can we ſincerely love him, but whatever ſhowes and pretences of kindneſs and reſpect we may ſhow to him otherwaies, whatever Courtſhip and Honour we may give to him by the Ceremonies of Worſhip, and the External Rights and Offices of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, yet he will account us only falſe and treacherous and hypocritical Wretches, and not accept of any thing elſe we offer to him: For,</p>
                  <p n="8">8, Allowing our ſelves in one ſuch darling Sin or beloved Luſt ſpoils all our Religious Duties and makes them both unacceptable to God and us unfit to performe them as we ought; He that allows himſelf in any ſecret Sin and unlawful Luſt how muſt he be ſunk into a ſenſual State that will keep him from riſing to Spiritual Thoughts and Exerciſes, his Mind is taken up
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:103342:259"/>with other apprehenſions and idea's of different objects, which he prefers to all the things of Religion and theſe ſink down his mind and bemire it in fleſh and ſenſe that it cannot uſe its wings or rational faculties and mount upwards to the purer objects of Faith and Religion: Thoſe vitious inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions muſt quench and put out the fire of Devotion and make the mind move ſluggiſhly and heavily in ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper work, and damp all its Religious Ardors and Affections; When a Man out of a Natural Senſe of God cannot excuſe himſelf wholly from worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and praying to him, (for I ſpeak not of ſuch as have caſt off all Religion, but only ſuch as allow themſelves in one wicked Luſt or unlawful Liberty) how muſt it be a violence to him to pray againſt a Sin and beg pardon of it and Grace to forſake it, when he ſecretly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to keep it and has no true and full deſign in his mind to leave it? What a ſtruggle muſt there be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Conſcience that is awakened by his Devotion and his ſenſual Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite which is ſo fond of the Sin that nothing can keep him from it, and who when he is deploring himſelf in
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:103342:259"/>the holy Offices yet intends to commit it the next opportunity? What hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Mockery and impudent Banter is this with the great and awful Majeſty of God? And what wretched Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie to make ſhows of great Honour and Addreſs to him when our hearts are not right with him, and we muſt know that <hi>he</hi> well knows they are not ſo? No Man could have the face to be ſo impudent to another as to come and make great court to him and expreſs great Reſpect and Reverence and Kindneſs for him, when he knew at the ſame time that the other alſo knew that this was all falſe and hypocritical, and that he took all occaſions at other times to affront and contemne and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige him? And yet thus every Man does who under all his Devotion and ſeeming Piety nouriſhes a ſecret ſin and an unlawful Luſt and demurely covers a vile fraud or injuſtice or any immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality: So that either a Man muſt throw off all Religion or throw off every ſecret and beloved Sin; for either his Sin will ſpoil his Religion or his Religion muſt cure him of his Sin, or he muſt have great Miſtakes and falſe Apprehenſions of Religion who
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:103342:260"/>thinks to compound with Heaven and to pay External Homage to it and that God will accept of that inſtead of inward Vertue and ſincere Obedience. One would think no Man could ever heartily performe one act of Devotion who has any ſuch ſin in reſerve that he will not part with, but I am ſure who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever does ſo his Devotion will never be accepted by God, and it will be in vain to worſhip him openly while we ſecretly diſobey him, ſuch a blemiſh ſpoils all our Sacrifices and deſecrates and pollutes the moſt ſacred oblations, and as the Prophet expreſt it to the <hi>Jews</hi> makes him <hi>that killeth an ox as if he ſlew a man, he that ſacrificeth a lamb as if he cut off a dogs neck, he that offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an oblation as if he offered ſwines blood, he that burneth incenſe as if he bleſſed an idol, Iſa.</hi> 6.3. and he giveth the reaſon at the latter part of the verſe, <hi>They have choſen their own ways and their ſoul delighteth in their abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,</hi> and theſe turn their very Prayers <hi>into ſin</hi> and make them an <hi>abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> to God, as Scripture aſſures us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.7. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.9. 'Tis ſtrange and unaccountable to conſider that a Man ſhould have ſome ſenſe of
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:103342:260"/>Religion and be govern'd by it in a great many things and live up to the Rules of it in ſeveral inſtances and yet be ſo beſotted and infatuated as to let one darling ſin overcome and enſlave him when he knows that <hi>this</hi> by the Principles of his Religion is as damnable and deſtructive as any of the reſt, which is juſt as if he ſhould be careful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his Health and avoid a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Diſeaſes and live by regular Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to that purpoſe and yet give himſelf a mortal ſtab and a wound that will certainly diſpatch him; for one Sin like one Wound may be Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and bring Death along with it as well as many, and one drop of Poyſon may kill, and one wilful ſin damn us as well as more.</p>
                  <p>God will not judge of our ſins as the Cuſtom and Opinion of the World does, nor abate of the Meaſures of our Duty and Conditions of our Salvation as we madly and unreaſonably do our ſelves, but whatever ſin ſtands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Divine Law however Modiſh or Common and Cuſtomary it be, that will not alter its Nature, nor take off its guilt and danger; one Mans Temper carries him to ſuch Sins that
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:103342:261"/>he thinks Fleſh and Blood cannot reſiſt anothes Trade or Buſineſs tempts him to others that he thinks 'tis impoſſible to get a Livelyhood without them, he cannot drive his Bargains with his Cuſtomers without immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate drinking nor Sell and Trade in the World without Cuſtomary Lying and perhaps Swearing, and to perſwade Men out of thoſe that their Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Condition or their Temper or Complexion do ſo ſtrongly diſpoſe 'em to, is to <hi>pluck out a right eye and cut off a right hand,</hi> I confeſs it is ſo in our Saviours ſenſe, but 'tis alſo very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to do this, to Cut off even the moſt pleaſant or advantagious Sin and deny even the moſt darling and belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Luſt if we would not be caſt into Hell hereafter and into a Bad State at preſent, our Saviours words there ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and imply that, but as he ſays <hi>'tis more profitable,</hi> more for our good Intereſt and Advantage to forego any pleaſure and part with any Advantage then for the ſake of them to expoſe our ſelves to ſuch a miſerable ſtate.</p>
                  <p>He that is truly afraid of Hell will not dare to live in any ſuch ſin as he knows will bring him thither, he muſt
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:103342:261"/>be ſtrangely thoughtleſs and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate or elſe a down-right Atheiſt Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del or Sceptick who can allow himſelf in any ſuch ſinful Liberties and undue Practices as are directly contrary to Religion and inconſiſtent with all the fears and the hopes of it and as one would think with all true Faith and belief of another World, but let every one that hath thoſe and any ſerious ſenſe of Religion remaining upon his Mind not venture to indulge himſelf in any ſecret or known Sin nor har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour any beloved vice or wickedneſs in his Soul, but let him though with the greateſt Self-denyal to his Temper or difficulty to his Circumſtances and Condition in the World break it off and teare it from his heart though it ſtick by never ſo many ſtrings and fibres and be like a ſecond Nature grown to it, like a Cancer it will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly kill us if it be not thus torn from the breaſt and ſo perfectly cut off, that none of its ſpreading Venom or Poyſon remain behind. He that has had any ſuch mortal illneſs growing upon his Mind or been guilty of any ſuch wilfull Sin as puts him into an ill ſtate, muſt thus Repent of it ſo as never again to
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:103342:262"/>commit it nor live in the practice of it afterwards or elſe till he do this he can have no hopes that he is recovered or got out of it, nor any reaſonable grounds to believe that he is in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition any way hopeful or comfortable, for</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, 'Tis only this mark of not committing any known and wilful ſin that diſtinguiſhes good Men who are <hi>born of God</hi> from thoſe who are wicked and <hi>the children of the Devil</hi> and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to God, and to be ſure there muſt be ſome very great and notorious difference between them and ſome plain and evident marks by which they may be known from one another, now thoſe are plainly given us by St. <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>Ep.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 8, 9. <hi>ver. He that commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ſin is of the Devil and whoſoever is born of God doth not commit ſin.</hi> Where nothing leſs can be meant by commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſin then living in the practice of any known ſin or wilful wickedneſs which deſtroys the image of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mind and ſo defiles and depraves our Souls that they are unlike to the pure and holy and unſpotted Nature of God, and when any Vice of Pride, Luſt Malice or the like abides upon
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:103342:262"/>them they bear theſe Marks and Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and likeneſs of accurſed Fiends and of their <hi>Father the Devil</hi> upon them in Scripture phraſe: There are none ſuch great Sinners as to break all the Divine Laws, ſome ſins are contrary to one another, and ſome may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our Inclinations, Complexions, or Conditions and Employments, but he that will violate any one Law as it ſuits with any of thoſe and will grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie any Luſt or Temptation as it is offered to him, he is one whom the Scripture denominates a Sinner in the high ſenſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> one who ſtands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by it to an ill ſtate here, and to Eternal Miſery hereafter, We are all Sinners in a low ſenſe as I ſhall ſhow preſently when I come to ſtate the difference of Mens ſins, and enquire what are and what are not conſiſtent with a good ſtate, but no Judgment could be made between a Good and a Bad Man if this did not diſtinguiſh them that the one though he may be encompaſt with a great many frailties and infirmities yet never allows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in one wilful known and deliberate wickedneſs which the other does; There may be degrees both of Sinners and
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:103342:263"/>of Good Men, ſome have attained to greater improvements and perfections both in Vice and Vertue and are more the Children of God or the Children of the Devil but that which divides their States and cuts the Line of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them muſt be this that the one allows himſelf in the practice of ſome known ſin or ſins which the other does not but carefully avoyds, and never commits any ſuch wilful Wickedneſs.</p>
                  <p>Though this ſeems very plain and undeniable and I have endeavoured to convince every one of the truth of it by the ſeveral Arguments I have brought to prove it, it being of great uſe to them to Judge and Examine themſelves by this plain and certain Mark and Criterion inſtead of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny falſe and uncertain ones that are given out as ſigns of Grace, and to judge thereby of their Spiritual Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and know whether they are in a Good or Bad State, yet there are two ſeemingly great objections againſt it, The one is the quite other Character and Account which St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives of himſelf in the Seventh Chapter to the <hi>Romans</hi> who was undoubtedly in a
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:103342:263"/>good ſtate and a Regenerate Man and yet ſpeaks of ſin <hi>dwelling in him,</hi> ver. 17. and <hi>that the good which he would he did not, but the evil which he would not, that he did;</hi> ver. 19. and <hi>that there was a war in his members warring againſt the law of his mind and bringing him into captivity to the law of ſin which is in his members,</hi> ver. 23. &amp;c. The other is that no Man lives without ſin, and that 'tis impoſſible he ſhould, for <hi>in many things we offend all,</hi> and <hi>if we ſay we have no ſin we deceive our ſelves</hi> as the Apoſtle ſays, and therefore to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all from a ſtate of Grace who live in any ſin and to make the <hi>not committing ſin</hi> the only true Mark and Sign of Grace is a very hard ſaying and a very ſevere thing and in effect is an excluding all Mankind ſince all are Sinners ſome way or other and none are ſo perfect as to live wholly without Sin: Now the firſt of theſe I ſhall anſwer very briefly becauſe I would not enter into any long diſpute about the ſenſe of that Chapter, and the other I ſhall more largely conſider in a diſtinct Section becauſe it will oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion my giving an account of the difference of ſins, what are and what
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:103342:264"/>are not conſiſtent with a Good State which is a very material point in the right ſtating and underſtanding the Nature of Repentance and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Sin.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then as to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s deſcription of himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. One of theſe two things muſt be allowed by all Sober and Underſtanding Men.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That if he ſpeaks in the Perſon of a Regenerate Man, as ſome would have it, then all the Phraſes and Expreſſions of <hi>ſin dwelling in him,</hi> and the like muſt relate only to thoſe ſins of Frailty and Infirmity which a good Man is liable to and cannot be wholly free from and which are therefore conſiſtent with a good State, as I ſhall particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſhow in the next Section; A Good Man, who is eſpecially under a ſtate of imperfect goodneſs and not arrived to any great degree of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian perfection may ſay of himſelf in many Caſes, <hi>that which I do I allow not</hi> I am guilty of many a haſty word, and undue paſſion and unreaſonable deſire and fooliſh imagination and the like which I do not approve of with my reaſon, but diſlike and wiſh I
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:103342:264"/>could be perfectly free from, and ſo in many caſes may ſay <hi>what I would that I do not</hi> many degrees of Charity and Devotion and other Vertues which I willingly would yet I do not perform, nor come up to ſuch a pitch of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as I gladly would but fall ſhort in many things of my Duty, and ſuch attainments as I would propoſe and come up to, ſuch an one may be very ſenſible of the <hi>body of death</hi> and the bondage of Corruption he is in and of the ſtrength of Concupiſcence and the Law in his Members warring againſt the Law of his Mind, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. But theſe may only relate to ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections and Infirmities and ſins of Frailty and Infirmity as may conſiſt with a Good State and belong to a Good Man, but they are by no means to be applyed further to the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any wilful and known and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſin which cannot be ſaid of a Regenerate Man or one in a good ſtate, and therefore,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some of thoſe Expreſſions in that Chapter ſeem to be ſuch as cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to a Good Man ſuch as thoſe ver. 14. <hi>I am carnal ſold under ſin,</hi> ver. 23. <hi>That the law of his members brought
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:103342:265"/>him into captivity to the law of ſin,</hi> ver. 25. <hi>That with his fleſh he ſerved the law of ſin,</hi> So that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to ſpeak here not of himſelf as a good Chriſtian but of an Unregenerate Perſon under the Convictions of the Law, and though he uſes his own name yet 'tis by a <hi>Metaſchematiſm</hi> a Figure uſual to him in other places, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.17, 18. <hi>If I build again the things which I deſtroy I make my ſelf a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor, and we our ſelves are ſtill found ſinners, Rom.</hi> 3.7. <hi>If the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie, why yet am I judged as a ſinner;</hi> where though he uſes his own Name yet 'tis under the Perſon of a Blaſphemous Objector, and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.2. <hi>If I have all faith and no charity what doth it profit me;</hi> which is an inoffenſive way of transferring odious things to our ſelves when we would deſcribe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them; Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> here only perſonates an unregenerate Man, for in other places he gives a quite other Character of a Regenerate one directly contrary to what is here, as that <hi>He hath crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſt,</hi> Gal. 5.24. <hi>and crucified the
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:103342:265"/>old man, Rom.</hi> 6.6. <hi>and that he is dead to ſin, Rom.</hi> 16.11. and <hi>free from ſin</hi> and <hi>the ſervant of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> Whereas here it is ſaid, <hi>that ſin dwelt in him,</hi> that <hi>he was carnal ſold un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſin,</hi> that <hi>the law of his members led him into captivity to the law of ſin,</hi> and <hi>that with his fleſh he ſerved the law of ſin,</hi> this muſt be the ſtate not of a good Chriſtian, but of a Man at leaſt under the Law and therefore the Apoſtle in oppoſition to this immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the other more happy ſtate of a Chriſtian under the Goſpel in the next Chapter and in anſwer to the grievous Exclamation, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death,</hi> he comfortably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to himſelf, <hi>I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> ver. 25. <hi>i. e.</hi> there is a remedy for it by Chriſt and Chriſtianity, and <hi>the law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus hath made me free from the law of ſin and death,</hi> ver. 2. chap. 8.</p>
                  <p>The Anſwer to the other Objection will be fully given in the next Section.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. II.</hi> The Differences of Sins, what are and what are not conſiſtent with a good State.</head>
                  <p>THAT all Men are Sinners not only Experience but the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do in many places aſſure us, that <hi>there is not a righteous man upon earth who ſinneth not;</hi> that <hi>in many things we offend all;</hi> and that <hi>if we ſay we have no ſin we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us;</hi> by which is not only meant that no Man is wholly free from all manner of Sin in the whole courſe of his Life, or can paſs all his dayes without falling into ſome Sin or other, but that no part of his Life, even when he is come to his beſt State, a State of Grace and Vertue, is ſo perfect as to be quite ſinleſs, and without any Sin of what kind ſoever, ſo that he ſhould not be obliged to beg Pardon of God, and ſay dayly, <hi>Forgive us our Treſpaſſes.</hi> Now this as it is matter of Humiliation to the beſt Men, ſo it is turn'd to another uſe and quite different purpoſe by the
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:103342:266"/>worſt; they comfort themſelves in all their greateſt Sins that all Men are Sinners as well as themſelves, that none are free from all Sins, and let them that are ſo caſt the firſt ſtone at them, they plainly confound hereby the different ſtates of good and bad Men, and are not willing to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh or make ſuch a true judgment as the Scripture does plainly between them, for the ſame Scripture that tells us all are Sinners and hath concluded all under Sin, yet declare that every wilful Sin is damnable, and that they who commit it and live in the practice of it <hi>ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> and that <hi>he who ſhall keep all the law</hi> beſides <hi>and yet offend in any one point is guilty of all,</hi> and ſhall be puniſh'd as truly though not ſo fully for one wilful unrepented Sin as for more.</p>
                  <p>There is no way to reconcile this, and take off any ſeeming difficulty about it, but by that plain difference which both Scripture and Reaſon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low between Sins, that ſome of them are Sins of Frailty and Infirmity which are unavoidable to us in our preſent
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:103342:267"/>ſtate, and which are conſiſtent with a good one, and which the beſt of Men cannot live wholly without whilſt they are in this Body of Fleſh and Blood, and that others are wilful and preſumptuous, known and deliberate Sins which are committed with full conſent of the Mind, and againſt a plain Law of God, and with that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and diſobedience that makes them unpardonable without a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Repentance and a perfect Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It concerns us very carefully to diſtinguiſh and know the difference between thoſe and not to erre to be ſure, on the wrong ſide by judging too kindly of our Sins, and calling thoſe Infirmities and Weakneſſes which are Sins of Wilfulneſs and Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor can we without judging right and avoiding Miſtakes on either hand judge truly and comfortably of our ſelves, and know what our Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſtate is, or what condition we are in as to God and another World. The only way to be ſafe is to avoid every Sin, at leaſt every wilful Sin, and to grow up to as high a degree of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Goodneſs as we can, and to get as much maſtery over all our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:103342:267"/>and Infirmities as is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but ſince ſome Sins and Frailties will cleave to us whilſt we carry this body of Sin and of Death about us, we may uſe the Pſalmiſts excellent Prayer both for our Inſtruction and our Devotion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.12, 13. <hi>Who can underſtand his errors? Cleanſe thou me from ſecret faults, keep back thy ſervant alſo from preſumptuous ſins, let them not have dominion over me, then ſhall I be upright, and I ſhall be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent from the great tranſgreſſion;</hi> where he gives us an account of ſeveral ſorts of Sins: 1. Such as he calls Errors and ſecret Faults, by which are meant Sins of Ignorance and Infirmity, which we are to pray God to forgive and free us from as well as from others. 2. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous Sins which implye ſuch as are both known and wilful, and thoſe 3. ſuch as have dominion over one, a reigning habitual prevailing power; now if we be kept free from theſe latter though not the former, we are ſafe and out of danger, in a ſtate of ſincerity and favour with God, and ſhall be treated as Righteous and Good Men notwithſtanding thoſe leſſer Faults. <hi>Then ſhall I be upright, and I
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:103342:268"/>ſhall be innocent from the great tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion; i. e.</hi> from any ſuch Sin as ſhall indanger my Soul, and expoſe it to Miſery and Damnation. I ſhall conſider and explain theſe ſeveral ſorts of Sins.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Errors and ſecret Faults,</hi> Sins of Ignorance and Infirmity, ſuch as we knew not to be Sins when we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them, either by a downright ignorance and not knowing any Law of God that forbad them, or by thoughtleſneſs ſurprize and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, being unawares engaged in them before we could think or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</p>
                  <p>As to Sins of Ignorance our Saviour told the <hi>Phariſees, John</hi> 9.41. <hi>If ye were blind ye ſhould have no ſin; i. e.</hi> If ye had been perfectly ignorant of the Meſſiahs coming into the World, and had had no knowledge of this by the Propheſies of old, and by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles which ye ſee me do, then your Infidelity and Unbelief had been excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable and without Sin. Where Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity is not revealed, as to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then World, where Faith is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Men with thoſe Arguments and Reaſons which ſhould perſwade
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:103342:268"/>to it, there God will not condemn them for their Ignorance which they could no way help, and which was only their misfortune and not their fault.</p>
                  <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour ſayes of the <hi>Jews, If I had not come and ſpoken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them they had not had ſin, Joh.</hi> 15.22. <hi>i. e.</hi> the Sin of Disbelieving and Rejecting him; as to other Sins known by their own Law, thoſe they had been anſwerable for to God, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>As many as have ſinned in the law ſhall be judged by the law,</hi> Rom. 2.12. <hi>and as many as have ſinned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out law ſhall periſh without law; i. e.</hi> the <hi>Gentiles</hi> who had not the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhall be condemned for their Sins by the Law of Nature.</p>
                  <p>It has been an uncharitable Queſtion whether any of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould be ſaved? Now tho' they cannot be ſaved in an ordinary way, by Vertue of the Chriſtian Covenant to which they have no title or claim, yet God may in extraordinary Mercy let all Mankind have the benefit of it, and ſave them by Chriſt though they know him not; but I am ſure he will never condemn them for not knowing Chriſtianity or
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:103342:269"/>the Goſpel which was not promulged or revealed to them.</p>
                  <p>There are many others whoſe Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance will no doubt excuſe them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God at the laſt day, ſuch who have lived under the darkneſs of Popery, and had no opportunity to know the groſs Corruptions of it; and others who by their unhappy Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and want of Education have had no means of inſtruction in the things of Religion, God will make gracious abatements to all thoſe for this and the conſequent ignorance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it which they could not help, and which was all things conſidered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable to them, and they will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Mercy like St. <hi>Paul</hi> for a great many faults becauſe they <hi>did them ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13.</p>
                  <p>There can be no plea or pretence for this in any of the plain and great Duties of Morality, becauſe thoſe are all known by the Light of Nature which God hath ſet up in every Mans Mind, and which is the great ſecurity of all Religion: But in matters pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſitive and which have not that clear evidence for them, but there may be occaſion for miſtakes and miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:103342:269"/>in things that are not ſo clearly Good and Evil in themſelves, but are of another Nature, of a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and arbitrary Inſtitution, there Mens Errors and Ignorances and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices may excuſe in great meaſure, though they act not according to the Rules of Chriſtianity and thoſe Orders which Chriſt and his Apoſtles have ſet up in the Church; and this is all the ground of Charity I can have for the deluded and ignorant Sectaries of all ſorts, many of which with honeſt well-meaning Minds may have great weakneſs of Judgment and want of Underſtanding, but God will judge Men at the laſt day rather by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity and ſincerity and honeſty of their Wills than by the truth and rightneſs of their Underſtandings. Indeed if Mens Ignorance be affected and wilful and ſuch as they might eaſily help if they would uſe means of inſtruction and information, and fairly conſider and examine things with ſuch helps as they have, then this Ignorance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a choſen fault of the Will, and ſo much as there is of that in it ſo far it is criminal and blamable, and this is its condemnation that it <hi>loveth dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:103342:270"/>rather than light,</hi> and refuſeth knowledge and inſtruction, and <hi>hateth the light neither cometh to the light leſt its deeds ſhould be reproved, Joh.</hi> 3.20.</p>
                  <p>There is an Ignorance of the Law and of the Fact, we may either not know that there is ſuch a Command given by God, or though there be ſuch a Law that ſuch an action comes not under it or is forbidden by it, as many are not ſenſible there is ſuch a Law concerning Church Union and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion as forbids all Schiſm and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, unleſs the terms of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion are ſinful and unlawful, or they do not think that worſhipping God in their own way falls under the crime of ſinful Schiſm or breach of Charity, but think it a very indifferent thing, and that there is no harm in it. Very many I doubt not do this, and 'tis only their Ignorance can excuſe them from a Sin that is very contrary to the great Commands of Chriſtian Peace and Unity. So others think there is no Idolatry in worſhipping God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an Image, or Chriſt in the Hoſt or Euchariſt, or praying to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and Saints and Angels, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them a leſſer worſhip than they do
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:103342:270"/>to God himſelf, and how far their Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance ſhall excuſe them God only can judge, but ſo far as it is no fault of their Wills, and is conſiſtent with the honeſty and ſincerity of their Minds, and is Morally unavoidable to them, ſo far it will be excuſed.</p>
                  <p>Next to Sins of Ignorance are Sins of Surprize and Inadvertency, when though we are not ignorant that ſuch actions are ſinful and againſt a Divine Law, yet we do not conſider it at that time nor are aware that they are ſo. As on a ſudden Paſſion when we have not time to think, when Fear or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger does ſo ſuddenly arreſt our thoughts that we have not time to conſider that what we do is blamable and faulty, though we know it is upon reflection and conſideration. Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> when he called the High Prieſt <hi>whited wall, Acts</hi> 23.3. being provoked by his unreaſonable command that they ſhould ſmite him on the mouth for ſaying only, <hi>that he had lived in all good Conſcience before God to this day, ver.</hi> 1. when he was reproved for this by ſome who ſtood by and ſaid, <hi>Revileſt thou Gods high-prieſt,</hi> He returned this Anſwer, <hi>I wiſt not bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:103342:271"/>that it was the high-prieſt.</hi> I did not conſider it, I was not aware of it, it was done inadvertently, for I know it is written in Gods Law, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſpeak evil of the ruler of thy people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus even St. <hi>Peters</hi> denyal of Chriſt was out of a ſudden fright and a fear that he ſhould be ſo uſed as he ſaw his Maſter was, and he conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not all his warnings, nor heard or minded the Cock crowing twice till Chriſt reminded him and looked upon him, and the Cock crew again, and then <hi>he went out and wept bitterly,</hi> for it was a grievous Sin though it had ſomething of ſurprize and inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency in it, and therefore found Pardon ſooner than thoſe deliberate Apoſtaſies and Denyings of Chriſt, which the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſpeaks of as more unpardonable than the Goſpel repreſents this.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> in a Paſſion threw down the Tables of the Divine Law, and <hi>brake them beneath the mount, Exod.</hi> 32.19. though the Tables were the work of God, and the Writing was the Writing of God graven upon the Tables, as 'tis ſaid there, and ſo 'twas a great diſreſpect to God, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. he
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:103342:271"/>being ſuddenly and extreamly provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with the ſight of the Golden Calf, and the Idolatrous dancing of the People about it.</p>
                  <p>Thus a good Man may be ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with a ſudden Paſſion, an undue Anger, haſty and raſh words, and ſpeaking unadviſedly with his Lips, and he may before he is aware be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized with a Temptation that ſhall make him have an undue Deſire, an unreaſonable Wiſh, a Luſtful or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Thought or Look, though he would not when he conſiders and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks himſelf commit any unlawful act perſuant or conſequent to any of thoſe, but the ſuddenneſs of the thing gives him not time to recollect or uſe his Reaſon as he would do, and this proceeds from an unavoidable infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Mind which cannot alwayes be upon its guard and provided againſt ſudden ſurprizes, but muſt think of a great many other things beſides thoſe of Religion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thoſe Natural Inclinations and firſt Motions of Concupiſcence that are in us to things forbidden and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful are only Sins of Infirmity, if they go no further than thoſe firſt
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:103342:272"/>Motions Thoughts and Deſires, and the Mind does not give any conſent to them, nor indulge or approve them, nor would gratifie them unduly and unlawfully had it power and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; for thoſe firſt Motions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations are neceſſary and unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ariſing from the frame and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of our Nature, and the Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm of our Body, Blood and Spirits, ſo that we can no more help or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them than we can the ſenſes of Pain and Pleaſure, or the Appetites of Thirſt or Hunger, or the Motions and Impreſſions of outward Objects made upon our Senſes, and therefore they are not ſimply evil but good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo far as they are Natural, and intended by God to ſerve the good of the World and of particular Perſons and the wiſe ends of Providence, but as they are irregular and inordinate, exceſſive and immoderate, and deſtroy thoſe ends for which God intended them ſo far they are ſinful, and when any of thoſe Natural Appetites or Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Inclinations grow too ſtrong and unruly, and are not kept under the government of Reaſon or within the bounds of Vertue and Religion, then
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:103342:272"/>they carry Men to all looſneſs and wickedneſs, and make them commit Sin and Uncleanneſs with greedineſs</p>
                  <p>A good Man may with St. <hi>Paul</hi> be very ſenſible and complain <hi>of this body of ſin and of death, and of the law of ſin that is in his members,</hi> of many ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular Appetites and undue Paſſions, and weak and fooliſh imaginations and unreaſonable deſires and inclinations, of too quick guſts of Senſual things, and too much deadneſs of Spiritual, of having too many thoughts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns for Earthly and preſent things and too little zeal and affection for things Heavenly that are a thouſand times more valuable. Theſe are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections that are in the beſt of us, and we ſee that they are ſo, and are very ſenſible and complain of them, but yet we cannot wholly avoid them, but after all our thoughts and all our care they ſtill return upon us, and <hi>the Fleſh will luſt againſt the Spirit,</hi> and there will be a perpetual war and ſtruggle between them; but if the Spirit do ſo far prevail by the helps of Grace and conſiderations of Religion, that it do never yield to any wilful Sin, it ſhall then be rewarded as a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:103342:273"/>which though it did not wholly ſubdue and drive out that homebred enemy, yet kept it alwayes under, and made it ſubmit to its Government and not keep up an open Rebellion againſt it. Of this I have largely diſcourſed in the Third Section of the Third Chapter.</p>
                  <p>I proceed now to thoſe Sins which are known wilful and preſumptuous, habitual and reigning in us, any one of which is inconſiſtent with a good State, and excludes us out of Gods Favour here and Heaven hereafter; ſuch as the Pſalmiſt in the forequoted place prayes againſt, <hi>Keep back thy ſervant alſo from preſumptuous ſins leſt they get the dominion over me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All known and wilful Sins are <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous,</hi> as being done in defiance of a Divine Authority that we know has forbid them, and in contempt of God and his Laws to whom we owe all Honour and Obedience, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all thoſe threatnings and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere puniſhments that God has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt them, <hi>He that ſins wilfully after he has received the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth</hi> of theſe things there remains nothing for him but <hi>a certain
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:103342:273"/>fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which ſhall devour the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is <hi>deſpiſing the Law of God,</hi> thus wittingly and wilfully to break it, and is <hi>ſinning with a high hand</hi> and a moſt preſumptuous boldneſs, when we chooſe to do that which we know is moſt highly diſpleaſing to Heaven, and which God has laid all the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he poſſibly can upon us not to do.</p>
                  <p>When any ſuch Sin gets dominion over us ſo that it becomes cuſtomary and habitual to us, it makes us the Devils ſlaves and captives at his Will, and ſhows that he is our Maſter and that we are the Servants of Sin, and overcome by that and brought in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to it, that it prevails upon our Minds above all the Power of Reaſon and Principles of Religion, and that we chooſe it above all the great things of Heaven and another World that Religion offers to us, and think it more deſirable than any of thoſe and had rather gratifie a paltry Luſt and a fooliſh Inclination than ſave our Souls and have all the favour of God, that we prefer it before any other good,
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:103342:274"/>and let it have the aſcendant in our Love and Affections above all other things; for it is utterly inconſiſtent with any Love of God or any due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to him, and baniſhes all Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Religion out of our Minds and deſtroyes all ſincerity and uprightneſs of Heart towards God, and abandons us to a ſtate of enmity with him and everlaſting deſtruction hereafter.</p>
                  <p>This I have ſhown is true of every wilful and choſen and known Sin.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now from the diſtinction I have given you of theſe Sins from thoſe of Infirmity, Ignorance and Inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, make the following Inferences and Remarks.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That thoſe Sins of Infirmity are to be Repented of, <hi>i. e.</hi> we are to be ſorry for them, and pray God to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them: Though they do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy our good ſtate, nor deprive us of Gods Favour here or Heaven here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, yet they are ſuch as are to be matter of Trouble and Sorrow and Humiliation to us, and we are dayly to pray God <hi>to forgive us our Treſpaſſes</hi> as Chriſt has taught us in the Lords Prayer; and the Pſalmiſt in the place before mentioned prayes
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:103342:274"/>God to <hi>cleanſe him from his ſecret faults</hi> as well as to <hi>keep him back from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous Sins.</hi> For</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Theſe are true and proper Sins, and though they are not charged upon us to our Condemnation, yet this is by the great Favour and Mercy of God, and by Vertue of the Gracious Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made in Chriſt with Mankind, for otherwiſe God in Rigour and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice might puniſh and condemn us for them. The Papiſts hold a diſtinction between Sins Mortal and Venial in their own Nature, <hi>i. e.</hi> that ſome Sins are in themſelves damnable and others not, which the Proteſtants have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally oppoſed for this Reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all Sin is in it ſelf Mortal, and in its own Nature deſerves Death, as being <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a breach and <hi>tranſgreſſion of a Divine Law</hi> whoſe ſanction is Death, but it is pardonable only by Gods Mercy on the account of its cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which make it more excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable with a good and merciful God, but that it is not of it ſelf venial or ſo little as not to deſerve Puniſhment, they prove from hence that we are bound to pray God to forgive it. Now it is pure Grace and Favour for God
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:103342:275"/>to forgive, and what he is not obliged to; and if he is not obliged to pardon it, he may puniſh it were it not for his Mercy and Goodneſs, and the Gracious Covenant he has made with us in the Goſpel. This ſhould therefore,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Make us very ſenſible of Gods infinite Mercy and kind dealing with us by the Covenant of Grace. How many innumerable Sins and Frailties are we guilty of in our Lives which are in ſtrictneſs deviations from the Divine Law? How many ſecret Sins are we to be cleanſed and freed from which we might be ignorant of when we committed or not remember after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and which are forgotten by us and blotted out of our memories, tho' they are not out of Gods, but he might impute and charge them to us would he enter into ſtrict Judgment with us? How many fooliſh Thoughts, raſh Words, irregular Paſſions, unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Deſires are we dayly guilty of, and how many defects and omiſſions of doing our Duty with leſs degrees of ardency frequency and perfection then we ought to do; theſe all ſtand in need of Divine Mercy, and this we ſhall be ſure of for Chriſts ſake if we
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:103342:275"/>are ſincere and hearty and upright in our Obedience, but this is a mighty Favour of God and of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and calls for a great ſenſe of Thankfulneſs and Gratitude.</p>
                  <p>To ſay we ſin dayly, and that the beſt things we do have Sin mixt with them is true in a certain ſenſe as there is ſome defect and imperfection in our moſt Holy Duties, and that we have ſome Infirmities that we ought dayly to confeſs and beg forgiveneſs of at Gods hands, but this is by no means true of any ſuch wilful Sin as every good Man muſt be free from whilſt he is in a good ſtate, and has a title to Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Under the Law God had provided a ſtanding Expiation for the leſſer Sins of Ignorance and Infirmity by the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and other Sacrifices, but there was none for preſumptuous Sins, but he that was guilty of them was to be cut off and dye without Mercy by the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Chriſtianity is a more Gracious Diſpenſation, and allowes Pardon for the greateſt Sin upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Amendment, and the Blood of Chriſt is a ſtanding Expiation for thoſe and all the leſſer and dayly
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:103342:276"/>Sins we commit, and Chriſt is our dayly Advocate and Interceſſor with God for them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When the Scripture ſayes that we are all Sinners, and that if we ſay we have no Sin we deceive our ſelves, and that there is not a Righteous Man who liveth and ſinneth not, and we by our dayly Confeſſions own our ſelves to be dayly Sinners; this is meant only of thoſe leſſer Sins of Frailty and Infirmity, Ignorance and Inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which I have explained to you, which are conſiſtent with a good State, which regenerate and holy Men are not quite free from, which neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy our own ſincerity nor Gods love to us nor our reaſonable hopes of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but any other Sins that are of a wilful and preſumptuous Nature, thoſe a good Man muſt be wholly free from, or elſe he loſes his Goodneſs and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Child of Wrath and Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till he recovers himſelf by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; and if he ever falls into any ſuch, he muſt exerciſe a moſt bitter and particular courſe of Repentance, and put himſelf into a ſtate of great Penitence, and bring himſelf to an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire amendment and forſaking of it
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:103342:276"/>till he can have any well grounded hopes of Pardon and Salvation.</p>
                  <p>There have been a great many Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes about attaining Perfection of Obedience and Vertue in this Life; ſome holding Erroneouſly that they could abſolutely and fully come up to it and live wholly without Sin; others as Erroneouſly that they were ſuch dayly Sinners as deſerved dayly Gods Wrath and Damnation, and that they ſinned in every thing they did. Now theſe extreams of Errors are eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled and cleared this way, that no one can come up to abſolute Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo as to live without the leſſer Sins of Frailty and Infirmity, but every good Man ought to be ſo perfect as to live without any wilful choſen and known Sin.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Even thoſe leſſer Sins we muſt ſtrive againſt and endeavour to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and maſter, and pray for the Divine Grace, and uſe all care and watchfulneſs againſt them, elſe they become wilful and voluntary by our neglect of them, and not uſing a due diligence to prevent and hinder them. Smaller Sins like leſſer and ſmaller Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes may affect and indiſpoſe the
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:103342:277"/>moſt ſound and healthful Conſtitution, but if they are neglected and ſuffered to grow too much upon it, they may become great and mortal. The firſt motions of Concupiſcence are not ſtrict Sins or at moſt but Sins of Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, but if thoſe firſt ſparks are not put out as ſoon as they are kindled but are ſuffered to glow and kindle within by moroſe thoughts and indulged fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and imaginations, they will break out into ſome undue acts and outward effects. If the Paſſions and Appetites that are Natural to us are not morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by due care exerciſe and thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs they will grow maſterleſs and ungovernable, and be at the beck of every Temptation that invites them, and run greedily after every Luſt that layes a proper object in their way or ſets it before them. A haſty fit of Anger if it be not put out may not go off in a ſudden blaze and expire in its own ſudden heats and Paſſion, but the Cholerick humour may concoct into malice and revenge and habitual ſpite and ill will, and ſo may a fretful pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhneſs and ſharpneſs of Temper ſpread like a Tetter, and grow incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and eat out all that ſweetneſs
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:103342:277"/>and meekneſs, kindneſs love and good Nature, which are to be the Vertues of a Chriſtian in all the proper acts of them, however ſower be their Blood or predominant their Spleen. God may abate in great meaſure for an unhappy Conſtitution, but he will never allow any wilful Sin as the effect of it. We muſt guard our ſelves with greater care and watchfulneſs where we know we lye open to any ſuch weakneſs, and call in all the helps of Religion to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie and defend us againſt any ſuch enemy that we are ſo much in danger of, elſe an impure an angry a covetous an ambitious thought and inclination nouriſhed in our Hearts and not watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over and corrected, may like a poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous ſeed or root of bitterneſs if ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to grow up, bring forth all the fruits that proceed from it, and make all thoſe ſinful corruptions in the Heart become wilful Sins, and produce actual Tranſgreſſions in our Lives.</p>
                  <p>We muſt not allow our ſelves in any Sins whatever upon pretence of their being little, for if we do they become wilful and choſen; and as the Wiſe Man ſayes, <hi>He that ſinneth by little and little ſhall periſh by little and
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:103342:278"/>little.</hi> A ſmall leak in a Ship may if it be not ſtop'd let in Water enough in time to ſink it, and a ſmall breach in the banks of a Sea-wall may cauſe a general inundation.</p>
                  <p>Some little Sins will adhere to the beſt of Men, but they muſt not be vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary or conſented to but brought upon them by ignorance ſurprize or inadvertency, and ſome unavoidable cauſe or neceſſity, which Morally ſpeaking is ſo to them, and they can never perfectly help it, for ſo much of will as there is in any Sin, ſo much there is of guilt, and whatever abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments there are in our willing it, by the Minds not knowing or not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, or being unawares ingaged in it, and not having the full uſe of its powers of choice or underſtanding, ſo much there is of excuſe for it, and ſo far its circumſtances make it pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by a good God who will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us for any thing we cannot help, and which it was not in our power to avoid, and all Sins of Infirmity are ſuch ſome way or other, for who can help being ignorant and miſtaken after he has uſed the beſt wayes he can to inform himſelf of his Duty, and if he
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:103342:278"/>then commit a Sin ignorantly, and through the meer error and weakneſs of his Underſtanding, God will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give it him.</p>
                  <p>So who can be alwayes ſo much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his guard and have his thoughts ſo much about him as not to ſay a raſh and unfit word or do a ſome way blameable action, or not have ſome inward motions and ſenſual deſires ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up in his Mind contrary to ſtrict Reaſon and Religion. If God ſhould for every one of theſe enter into Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with us or condemn us, no Man could be ſaved, and no Fleſh living could be juſtified: But he who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders our frame and knows that we are but duſt, weak, imperfect, blind, ignorant, inconſiderate, heedleſs Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, made up of Senſual Paſſions, Appetites and Inclinations that are a part of our Nature, he will deal very graciouſly and favourably with us, and not puniſh us for any unavoidable weakneſſes of our Nature but only for the wilful faults and preſumptuous miſcarriages that we wittingly and willingly commit againſt him and his Laws.</p>
                  <p>God alone can perfectly judge and exactly diſtinguiſh between all the
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:103342:279"/>faults of weakneſs and wilfulneſs, and tell what degrees of voluntary and involuntary, and ſo of blame and guilt are in them, he knoweth our Hearts and ſearcheth our Reins, and can bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter judge of our Actions and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſprings of them than our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>In great and notorious caſes every Mans Conſcience can judge for him, but <hi>God is greater than our Conſciences and knoweth all things,</hi> and if we ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely avoid every wilful and great and notorious Sin, and would not for any Temptation in the World commit it, if as the Pſalmiſt ſayes, <hi>We be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and innocent from the great tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,</hi> 'tis to be hoped all our other Sins and Miſcarriages are Sins of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable Weakneſs and excuſable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, that do no way endanger our good State; and whatever wilful Sins we have been guilty of through the whole courſe of our Lives, our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving left them and truly Repented of them, as I have directed, frees us from all the dangers of them, and puts us into the Bleſſed State of Pardon and Forgiveneſs, notwithſtanding the leſſer Sins of Frailty and Infirmity which we cannot live wholly without.</p>

<pb n="538" facs="tcp:103342:281"/>as guilt when it lies heavy upon a Mans Mind and he has a quick ſenſe and apprehenſion of it, this is to be ſtung with Scorpions to be whipt with Snakes to have burning Torches and all the conceived inſtruments of torture applyed to us, There is no tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo great as a Mans Conſcience ſtruck with the horrors of its own guilt, haunted with its own fears as ſo many Furies or evil Spirits following and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing it wherever it goes, when it has the image of its own foul actions always before it, and imagines a Divine Judgment and Nemeſis always behind it, when the very chattering of the Birds ſpeaks its crimes to it as in a known ſtory, and the hand-writing upon the wall makes it tremble and be amazed, and its own inward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs makes it hear and ſee and read its ſad doom and ſentence in all places and on all occaſions, what a lamentable condition muſt a Man be in when he lies thus under the load of his ſins and the burden is greater than he can bear, and his perplexed mind is in ſuch Agonies and Anguiſh as is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible; That ſure muſt be a very comfortable thing which will take him
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:103342:281"/>off of this Rack, and put him into a ſtate of Eaſe and Quiet when he is thus tormented, and be a preſent Anodyne to relieve his pains. Mankind there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were in all times very inquiſitive and very much concerned to find out a way if it was poſſible to expiate ſin and atone guilt, they built Altars and offered Sacrifices and ſlew Thouſands of Sheep and Oxen upon an hundred Hills and came by degrees to offer up Men and to ſlay their own Children and <hi>to give their firſt born for their tranſgreſſion, the fruit of their bodies for the ſin of their Souls,</hi> as the Prophet expreſſes it <hi>Micah</hi> 6.7. They would part with any thing however coſtly or dear to them to free themſelves from the pain and fear they were under and give any hopes or eaſe to their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and timorous and perplext Minds, This was a great cauſe of moſt of the Heathen Superſtitions, of their Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Luſtrations Sacrifices and the like, whereby they hoped to clear and purifie their guilty minds and appeaſe the Anger of that Divine Vengeance that they were ſenſible hung over their heads by reaſon of their ſins; This ſhowed the greatneſs of the Diſeaſe and
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:103342:282"/>the want and neceſſity there was of a Remedy for it, which they being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, uſed all the means they could think of and tryed all wayes however odd and fooliſh to help themſelves; but it was only Chriſtianity could fully make known the Expiation of ſin by the Sacrifice of Chriſt and <hi>our having Redemption by his blood even the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins</hi> upon our true Repentance, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.14.</p>
                  <p>This is the moſt bleſſed Meſſage and Goſpel from Heaven to a poor guilty Sinner, this is <hi>preaching good tidings to the meek and humble ſinner, Binding up the broken-hearted, proclaiming liberty to the captives, opening the priſon to them that are bound, comforting them that mourn,</hi> as the Goſpel is deſcribed by the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1. and in our Saviours own phraſe 'tis <hi>giving reſt to them that are weary and heavy laden</hi> by reaſon of their ſins, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28. when though we are conſcious to our ſe ves of a great many faults we have committed in our lives and ſome of them ſuch as fill us with ſhame hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and confuſion when we think of them yet we are aſſured they are all blotted out by Repentance and the
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:103342:282"/>whole guilt of them done away as if we had never committed them, this gives great eaſe and peace to our thoughts when our Conſcience is thus diſcharged of all guilt and the terrible fears and apprehenſions of it; this is more comfortable to the mind than to be eaſed of the moſt tormenting pain of body, to have voided a ſharp ſtone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a fit or have a throbbing Ulcer broke and cured, 'tis unexpreſſible pleaſure to be put thus out of pain, and be reſtored to the peace and comfort of a Mans own Mind, when he had once loſt it.</p>
                  <p>He who has ſo truly Repented of his Sins as I have directed hath all Reaſon for this, for he hath as ſure grounds of Pardon and needs no more fear Puniſhment than if he had been alwayes innocent and never had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended or done any thing amiſs; tho' his Sins fill'd his Mind with Sorrow before, and gathered all the black Clouds of Grief and Melancholly over his thoughts, yet now they ought to be diſperſed and he may chear up and be comforted. If he has any Fears they are unreaſonable, for if his Sins are perfectly gone they ought to be gone too.</p>

                  <p>While he was under the guilt of his Sins he had reaſon with St. <hi>Peter to weep bitterly,</hi> with <hi>David to waſh his bed with his tears,</hi> that Bed which he had ſo polluted before; with <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> to vent ſo many tears as might <hi>waſh her Saviours feet,</hi> and then wipe them with the Hair of her Head, that ſo ſhe might do Penance with thoſe Meretricious Eyes and Locks which had drawn others into Sin. The Pious Penitents of old had all the ſigns and ſymptoms of the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt mourning and lamentation for their ſins, aſhes upon their head, ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth upon their loins, <hi>lying down in their confuſion becauſe they had ſinned,</hi> ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their Breaſts with the <hi>Publican</hi> and every one crying out in the anguiſh of his Soul with the <hi>Pſalmiſt, My iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are gone over my head, and are a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy burden too grievous for me to bear: My iniquities have taken hold upon me, ſo that I am not able to look up, they are more than the hairs of my head, therefore my heart faileth me:</hi> Theſe are the words, and theſe the Paſſions and this the Picture of a Penitent under a ſtate of penitence and the guilt of his ſins, but now upon his true Repentance all
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:103342:283"/>Tears are to be wiped from his Eyes, or at leaſt the ſame fountain is to ſend forth ſweet Water that did bitter and that is to become a Balm and an Oyl of gladneſs to his Soul which was ſo ſharp and corroſive before, His Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance will now be his greateſt comfort which was ſo ſevere and ſo bitter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and when his Wounds are healed and bound up and the operation is over, <hi>The bones which were broken will rejoice and he will hear of joy and gladneſs</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſighs ſorrow and contrition. He who had ſo much Reaſon to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and diſpleaſed with himſelf before by reaſon of his Sins and his Folly, will now be pleaſed and ſatisfied when he is grown wiſer and better, and will have that ſolid ſatisfaction and laſting pleaſure in his own Mind, which is a thouſand times greater than all the vain and empty and ſhort-lived pleaſures of his Luſts and Vices, and he will now have a thouſand times more inward eaſe by the practice of Repentance than he had before by the practice of his moſt grateful Sins.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Repentance as it will free him from the preſent unhappineſs of his Sins and Guilt, ſo it will deliver him
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:103342:284"/>from the fears of more dreadful Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in another World, and from the dangers which he is expoſed to here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after by reaſon of his Sins. This is the chief and great Reaſon why a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is in ſuch anguiſh and horrour and perplexity at preſent becauſe his guilt forebodes greater Miſeries to him and his conſcious mind has a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Spirit that foretels evil things to come upon him hereafter; He knows he deſerves puniſhment and vengeance to fall upon him and he therefore fears though he has a ſhort reſpite here yet it ſhall be unavoidable and in a greater meaſure hereafter. Religion is ſo Natural to the reaſon of our minds and has ſuch a ſure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both in Nature and Revelation that hardly any Sinner can ſhake off all ſenſe of it and free himſelf from the fearful belief and expectations of its future puniſhments, and though he laughs at them ſometimes and would ſeem in his higheſt mirth to have cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage enough to make a jeſt of them to others yet he fears them in good earneſt, and trembles at the thoughts of them when he is alone and when Death brings them nearer to him he
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:103342:284"/>is ſcared and terrified and has ſufficient proof of their Reality in his own mind, What a wretched and miſerable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is he then in when the terrors of Death and the greater terrours of Hell are ſet before him, when all about him is horror and miſery and the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of darkneſs, when he has nothing to look back upon but the bitter me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of his paſt ſins and no proſpect before him but the unknown and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable torments of another World, when Gods. Anger lyes heavy upon him and ſinks him into the deepeſt gulph of deſpair and the Grave and the bottomleſs pit are ready to ſwallow him up and to devour him both Soul and Body; what an inſtance of Miſery is here, what a Picture of Hell, nay what a real and ſenſible Hell is there then before us? Who that ſtands by the Bed of ſuch a dying Wretch and draws the Curtains and ſees the Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and hears the doleful expreſſions of ſuch a miſerable Creature would not be deeply affected with ſuch a ſad ſtate as he ſees a Man put into by ſin and impenitence? Who would not then think Vertue and Religion very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and very deſirable things and
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:103342:285"/>much to be preferred to ſinful looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and extravagance? Who would not then give all the World either that he had not ſin'd or that he had Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in time and ſo not brought himſelf into that remedileſs ſtate of preſent and future torment? Repentance if it be true and ſincere will prevent a Sinners coming to this which will otherwiſe certainly be his Portion and he can never eſcape it in this World if he be not ſtupid, but to be ſure not in the next. Now who that knows he muſt dye in a little time and that then at fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt this will be his caſe if he go on in his ſins and be not timely brought off from them would ever madly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in them and not break them off by Repentance when he is all the while expoſed to this dreadful danger and lyes open to the fears and miſeries of another World:</p>
                  <p>How comfortable is it to be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from thoſe and to live in ſuch a ſtate that a Man has no reaſon to be afraid of Death nor to be ſcared with the thoughts of another World? But whenever it comes he can welcome it chearfully, or at leaſt ſubmit to it pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently without horror and diſtraction
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:103342:285"/>and have reaſonable and well-groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded hopes that it ſhall be well with him hereafter, full aſſurance he may never have without all manner of fears but he will have chearful and rational hopes according to the certainty and evidence of his Repentance and the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of his Vertue and Obedience, ſuch a conditional aſſurance every one has by a Faith truly Divine that if he thus repents he ſhall be ſaved, this is founded on a propoſition that is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely revealed, and ſo is matter of Faith, but that I have ſo repented is not matter of Faith but only of private Judgment, and Opinion of my ſelf, but I have no reaſon to doubt or be afraid if I know upon examining my ſelf that I have forſaken every wilful ſin and have left the ill courſe of life I was in and would not for any profit or pleaſure commit a wilful Sin though I were never ſo much tempted to it and it were never ſo much in my power, and that I have thus endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to live and to do my Duty ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely to God and Man though with great imperfections and infirmities ſtill upon me, this will give us a Rational and a Moral aſſurance of our Salvation
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:103342:286"/>which is all we can have without a particular Revelation, how will this cheer and ſupport a Man when he comes to dye, how will it take out the ſting and allay the bitterneſs of Death in great meaſure, and be the beſt Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial to keep up his Spirits in his laſt Agonies and Extremities, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to himſelf of his own ſincerity and his conſcience not condemning him as to any wilful Sin, <hi>He will have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence towards God, and can aſſure his heart before him,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.19. He can then ſafely truſt and rely upon the Mercy of God in and thorough Chriſt for the pardon of all his ſins becauſe he has truely and in time repented of them, and 'tis not a mere preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ungrounded confidenee which like <hi>the hope of the hypocrite ſhall periſh, Job</hi> 8.13. but he has a ſure Title to it by the Goſpel and <hi>the ſpirit of God beareth witneſs with his ſpirit,</hi> and by the joynt teſtimony of that and his Conſcience agreeing with the Rules and Meaſures of the Goſpel (for otherwiſe 'tis but deceit and deluſion) he hath great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comfort and chearful hopes of Heaven and hath no reaſon to fear but it ſhall be well with him in another
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:103342:286"/>world. 'Tis very happy to live in ſuch a ſtate as this where we are provided againſt not only all the evils of this World and the worſt that can happen to us here but againſt Death and all the evils of another, and may chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully enjoy the bleſſings of Providence at preſent and rejoyce in the hopes of a much greater happineſs hereafter, ſo that we may as the wiſe Man ſays, <hi>Eat our bread with joy and drink our wine with a merry heart for God now accepteth our works, Eccleſ.</hi> 9.7. but a ſtate of ſin and impenitence is a dreadful and a hazardous ſtate, expoſed to the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of Death and the amazing Evils of another World, ſo that if a Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd it as he ought he could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy himſelf one moment, nor would ever live under the fears and dangers of it for all the World, and what if he thinks not of it which is all the relief he has againſt it?

Repentance puts us into a very bleſſed and happy ſtate as it reconciles us to God and reſtores us to his favour who was before angry and diſpleaſed with us; <hi>We are enemies to God by our wicked works</hi> and <hi>alienated from him, Coloſſ.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Our iniquities have ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated between us and our God and our ſins have hid his face from us, Iſa.</hi> 59.2. 'Tis they make the only breach and ſeparation between God and his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and provoke him who is Love and Goodneſs to put on Wrath and Anger and become even <hi>a conſuming fire,</hi> ſo that <hi>his anger</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againſt ſinners and wax hot againſt them</hi> and <hi>he poureth out the fierceneſs of his anger upon them</hi> and <hi>they drink of the cup of his fury</hi> and feel his wrath and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation; many a ſinner has done this and cryed out in the Anguiſh of his Soul, <hi>Thy wrath lyeth hard upon me, Pſal.</hi> 88.7 <hi>Thy fierce wrath goeth over me, thy terrors have cut me off, ver.</hi> 16. <hi>Fearfulneſs and trembling are come upon me and horror hath overwhelmed me, Pſal.</hi> 55.5. <hi>Thine arrows ſtick faſt in me and thy hand preſſeth me ſore, Pſal.</hi> 38.2. <hi>Who knoweth the power of thine anger even according to thy fear ſo is thy

God who is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as he can convey ſecret and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable comfort into our Souls ſo he can impreſs intolerable and unſpeakable horrors upon them, and who is able to bear the weight of his Anger or endure the ſenſe of his Wrath and Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? In his Pleaſure and Favour is Life and in his Anger is a double Death to the Soul, The inward Senſation and Perception of Gods Love is the ohiefeſt joy and happyneſs to a Soul either in this World or the other, and the Senſe and Perception of his Anger is the greateſt Miſery; God the fountain of all Happineſs doth diffuſe and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate ſuch a Peace Joy Comfort to good Souls, ſuch an inward Taſte and Reliſh of Spiritual Pleaſure and Delight as is unſpeakable, <hi>paſt underſtanding,</hi> called <hi>joy in the holy Ghoſt,</hi> and is no doubt the ſweeteſt and moſt affecting pleaſure a Soul is capable of, this the Angels and bleſſed Spirits above enjoy, and are tranſported with the moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing Senſe and Rapturous Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it and 'tis what makes Heaven to them, and a little foretaſte of it when
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:103342:289"/>God <hi>lifts up the light of his countenance upon us</hi> when a pious Soul <hi>taſts and ſees how good and gracious God is, this puts more gladneſs in the heart</hi> than Corn and wine and oyl and all worldly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, now on the contrary when God hides his face and withdraws his loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs and imprints a ſtrong ſenſe of his Wrath and Anger upon the Mind this is the utmoſt and the deepeſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, this gives the bittereſt ſenſe of Evil, fills it with the greateſt horrors, ſinks it into the deepeſt gulph the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs Pit of Miſery, and is the very Puniſhment and Hell of the damned.</p>
                  <p>How happy is it then to be Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God by Repentance whom we had angred and provoked by our ſins before we feel any of this and before his Wrath and Anger is poured out upon us, it will certainly fall upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sinner ſome time or other unleſs he Repents, for God though he defers his Anger for ſome time that his Goodneſs and long-ſuffering may lead us to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance yet his abuſed Love Patience and Mercy will turn to greater Wrath and Fury if we perſiſt in our ſins and in a courſe of impenitency.</p>

               <head>THE CONCL<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SION.</head>
               <p>To Conclude, As all general Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Duties are meant by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſo all general Chriſtian-Priviledges and Benefits belong to it and are the Rewards of it, for as Repentance is the ſame thing in Scripture with <hi>Converſion, Regeneration, the New Birth, the New Creature, the New Man</hi> and the like, thoſe different words and figurative expreſſions deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting only the ſame duty, importing the great Change and Alteration made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Mind and Life of a Sinner by the power of Grace and Religion, So all the benefits and priviledges of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity ſuch as Election, Adoption, Pardon, Juſtification at preſent and Glorification afterwards which are free and gratuitous acts in God, granting
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:103342:290"/>and beſtowing thoſe Favours upon us for Chriſts ſake upon our being duely qualified and fitted to receive them, <hi>Theſe</hi> all belong to thoſe who have truly Repented and become good Men, and to none elſe: For God hath only Choſen, Adopted, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, Juſtified, and will Glorifie ſuch and no other, and till we have Repented we have no good claim or title to any of thoſe. Our being in a good State towards God which is the thing meant by all thoſe Phraſes under ſome different conſiderations, is on our ſide wholly owing to our true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Obedience; and it is all loſt and forfeited by our Impenitency and Diſobedience, which on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary make us the Children of Wrath, the Children of the Devil and Heirs of Damnation, put us into the worſt Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual State of Reprobation, Obdura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Excecation, according to the degrees of our Sins and Impenitence, and into that of Condemnation it ſelf, which is the word that directly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to that of Juſtification.</p>
               <p>All thoſe Scriptural Phraſes and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of a good State belong to Repentance, and to the true Chriſtian
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:103342:290"/>Penitent, and all thoſe which ſignifie a bad one belong as truly to Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Impenitence; for though without the Free-Grace and Mercy of God in and thorough Chriſt we could not be put into any ſuch good State, nor have a title to any ſuch Priviledges meerly by vertue of our Repentance or any thing we could do, yet to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that God will put us into thoſe ſtates without any regard to our own Actions or not upon the account of them, is to deſtroy all Religion, all Divine Government, all Future Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and all Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in another World. I might clear and illuſtrate and enlarge upon theſe, had not this Diſcourſe already ſwelled upon my hands into too great a bulk, and did they not run into ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Controverſie which I would carefully avoid.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore only give this laſt Advice to the Penitent who hath brought himſelf by the Grace of God into this Good and Happy State, that when he is thus got out of the Paths of Death and of Sin into thoſe of Life and Vertue, that he would go on and proceed in the new and right way he
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:103342:291"/>is in, and make a ſpeedy and further progreſs in all Piety and Goodneſs, that like St. <hi>Paul forgetting thoſe things which are behind, and reaching unto thoſe which are before,</hi> he may follow and apprehend them, and ſo <hi>preſs</hi> forward <hi>towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus, Phil.</hi> 3.13, 14. that now he is become a Chriſtian in good earneſt he would more zealouſly promote that Religion which he oppoſed and was an enemy to before, and ſhow he is a true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert by his zeal and earneſtneſs againſt Vice and Irreligion, that he would make all amends he can for his paſt miſcarriages by doing the greateſt good he is able, by ſerving God and his Glory more heartily, and thus <hi>loving much becauſe much is forgiven him,</hi> ſo that <hi>where ſin abounded grace may much more abound,</hi> and he may make up the failures as far as he can of his former Life, and give the beſt ſatisfaction and reparation he is able to God and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion whom he had ſo highly injured and affronted; that he may not be contented only to get out of an ill State, and be juſt ſafe and out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but may endeavour to riſe higher
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:103342:291"/>
                  <hi>and grow in Grace</hi> and all manner of Goodneſs, and attain to higher im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements and perfections of Vertue and Holineſs. This ſhould be his aim and deſign and the buſineſs of his whole Life, and this will certainly be ſo if he has the true love of Vertue, of God or of Heaven in his Soul, he will then be doing more good, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more vertuous <hi>more rich towards God,</hi> and continually thriving and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing in his good Condition and his Heavenly Treaſure, as Worldly Men are in their Earthly Trades and Riches, he will be dayly adding to his ſtore, and knowing the worth of Vertue the more, the more he hath of it, he will by a laudable Covetouſneſs be every day raiſing his Stock, improving his Talents, and abounding more and more in all uſeful Vertues and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian good Works, which ſhould be the great buſineſs and deſign of every Chriſtian all his Life.</p>
               <p>This will give unſpeakable comfort peace and ſatisfaction to his Mind, and ſet him not only out of danger and free him from an ill ſtate, but out of all doubts fears and uncertainties in his thoughts about it; for the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:103342:292"/>we grow in Vertue the more chearful and well-grounded hopes and aſſurance we ſhall have in our ſelves, and the more <hi>confidence towards God.</hi> 'Tis hard to know and diſtinguiſh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly between the firſt lines and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Vice and Vertue, of a bad and good State, where the loweſt degree of one begins and the other ends, as 'tis difficult to know the firſt concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and beginning of Life in an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brio, and the firſt day-break of the morning; but when Life appears by ſenſible motions and viſible acts and operations there is no doubt about it, nor when the Sun is up and come to the Meridian that it is perfect day, ſo what is the beginning of the Spiritual Life in a Chriſtian Penitent, or when he firſt is delivered from the Power of Darkneſs into Light and a Chriſtian good State is not ſo eaſily known, but 'tis plain and clear when he performs the proper acts and operations of the Divine Life and <hi>walks as a child of light,</hi> and <hi>his goodneſs ſhines more and more unto perfect day; i. e.</hi> when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more thoroughly vertuous and more perfectly a good Man, it will be more out of doubt to himſelf, and he
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:103342:292"/>will have all the chearful and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able evidence of it to his unſpeakable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. 'Tis generally very low and imperfect degrees of Religion and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue that make us fearful and doubtful; the more perfect we grow the more aſſured we ſhall have reaſon to be of our good State, and though the Penitents tears at firſt bring clouds and darkneſs, fear and melancholly over him, yet perfect Vertue when he is reſtored to it will make a perfect day, and bring in the cleareſt comfort peace and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to his Mind; and thus though <hi>he ſowed in Tears he ſhall reap in Joy.</hi>
